      Transcriber's Notes:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Numbers (Roman and Arabic) in square brackets, [29], in the right margin
      represent original manuscript pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letters in Square brackets, [AB], represent a link to a footnote located
      at the end of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      m&#772; and n&#772; sometimes are used to represent a double letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      16<sup>li</sup>. represents 16 pounds in monetary terms. The original
      manuscript used a middle dot before and after the numbers, but this
      publisher used only a single period/stop after the number.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'li' appears to mean libra and in this book the 'l' is crossed with a
      middle bar or stroke. It was very difficult to represent in a Latin-1
      text, so 'li' must suffice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most often y, such as y<sup>e</sup>, represents a thorn and the word is
      'the'. Sometimes you will encounter the actual word 'the'.
    </p>
    <p>
      This book is composed of many letters written by a number of authors and
      each writer uses their own spellings and abbreviations, which was common
      for the time in which they were written.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spelling is inconsistent and is left unchanged from the original printing
      of this book.

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To many people the return of the Bradford Manuscript is a fresh discovery
      of colonial history. By very many it has been called, incorrectly, the log
      of the "Mayflower." Indeed, that is the title by which it is described in
      the decree of the Consistorial Court of London. The fact is, however, that
      Governor Bradford undertook its preparation long after the arrival of the
      Pilgrims, and it cannot be properly considered as in any sense a log or
      daily journal of the voyage of the "Mayflower." It is, in point of fact, a
      history of the Plymouth Colony, chiefly in the form of annals, extending
      from the inception of the colony down to the year 1647. The matter has
      been in print since 1856, put forth through the public spirit of the
      Massachusetts Historical Society, which secured a transcript of the
      document from London, and printed it in the society's proceedings of the
      above-named year. As thus presented, it had copious notes, prepared with
      great care by the late Charles Deane; but these are not given in the
      present volume, wherein only such comments as seem indispensable to a
      proper understanding of the story have been made, leaving whatever <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>elaboration
      may seem desirable to some future private enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a matter of regret that no picture of Governor Bradford exists. Only
      Edward Winslow of the Mayflower Company left an authenticated portrait of
      himself, and that, painted in England, is reproduced in this volume. In
      those early days Plymouth would have been a poor field for portrait
      painters. The people were struggling for their daily bread rather than for
      to-morrow's fame through the transmission of their features to posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The volume of the original manuscript, as it was presented to the Governor
      of the Commonwealth and is now deposited in the State Library, is a folio
      measuring eleven and one-half inches in length, seven and seven-eighths
      inches in width and one and one-half inches in thickness. It is bound in
      parchment, once white, but now grimy and much the worse for wear, being
      somewhat cracked and considerably scaled. Much scribbling, evidently by
      the Bradford family, is to be seen upon its surface, and out of the
      confusion may be read the name of Mercy Bradford, a daughter of the
      governor. On the inside of the front cover is pasted a sheet of manilla
      paper, on which is written the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        "<i>Consistory Court of the Diocese of London</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the matter of the application of The Honorable Thomas Francis Bayard,
        Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>in London of the United States
        of America, for the delivery to him, on behalf of the President and
        Citizens of the said States, of the original manuscript book entitled
        and known as The Log of the Mayflower.
      </p>
      <p>
        Produced in Court this 25th day of March, 1897, and marked with the

      Then come two manilla leaves, on both sides of which is written the decree
      of the Consistorial Court. These leaves and the manilla sheet pasted on
      the inside of the front cover were evidently inserted after the decree was
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next comes a leaf (apparently the original first leaf of the book), and on
      it are verses, signed "A. M.," on the death of Mrs. Bradford. The next is
      evidently one of the leaves of the original book. At the top of the page
      is written the following:&mdash;

      At the bottom of the same page the name John Bradford appears in different

      Following this, on the same page, is Thomas Prince's printed book-mark, as
      follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="center">

    <p>
      <i>It now belongs to the Bishop of London's Library at Fulham.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are evidences that this leaf did not belong to the original book,
      but was inserted by Mr. Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the first page of the next leaf, which was evidently one of
      the original leaves of the book, is written in Samuel Bradford's hand,
      "march 20 Samuel Bradford;" and just below there appears, in Thomas
      Prince's handwriting, the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        But major Bradford tells me &amp; assures me that He only lent this Book

      Below this, also in Thomas Prince's handwriting, appears this line:&mdash;

    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        "Page 243 missing when ye Book came into my Hands at 1st."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Just above the inscription by Prince there is a line or two of writing,
      marked over in ink so carefully as to be wholly undecipherable. On the
      reverse page of this leaf and on the first page of the next are written
      Hebrew words, with definitions. These are all in Governor <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>Bradford's
      handwriting. On the next page appears the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      <i>Though I am&nbsp; growne&nbsp; aged, yet I have had a long-<br /> ing

    <p>
      Then begins the history proper, the first page of which is produced in
      facsimile in this volume, slightly reduced. The ruled margins end with
      page thirteen. From that page to the end of the book the writing varies
      considerably, sometimes being quite coarse and in other places very fine,
      some pages containing nearly a thousand words each. As a rule, the writing
      is upon one side of the sheet only, but in entering notes and subsequent
      thoughts the reverse is sometimes used. The last page number is 270, as
      appears from the facsimile reproduction in this volume of that page. Page
      270 is followed by two blank leaves; then on <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>the second page of the next
      leaf appears the list of names of those who came over in the "Mayflower,"
      covering four pages and one column on the fifth page. The arrangement of
      this matter is shown by the facsimile reproduction in this volume of the
      first page of these names. Last of all there is a leaf of heavy double
      paper, like the one in the front of the book containing the verses on the
      death of Mrs. Bradford, and on this last leaf is written an index to a few
      portions of the history.
    </p>
    <p>
      For copy, there was used the edition printed in 1856 by the Massachusetts
      Historical Society. The proof was carefully compared, word for word, with
      the photographic <i>facsimile</i> issued in 1896 in both London and
      Boston. The value of this comparison is evident in that a total of sixteen
      lines of the original, omitted in the original first copy, is supplied in
      this edition. As the work of the Historical Society could not be compared,
      easily, with the original manuscript in London, these omissions, with
      sundry minor errors in word and numeral, are not unreasonable. The curious
      will be pleased to learn that the supplied lines are from the following
      pages of the manuscript, viz.: page 122, eight lines; page 129, two lines;
      the obverse of page 201, found on the last page of Appendix A, two lines;
      page 219, two <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>lines;
      pages 239 and 258, one line each. The pages of the manuscript are
      indicated in these printed pages by numerals in parentheses.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several errors in the paging of the original manuscript. Pages
      105 and 106 are marked 145 and 146, and pages 219 and 220 are marked 119
      and 120, respectively. Page 243 is missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such as it is, the book is put forth that the public may know what manner
      of men the Pilgrims were, through what perils and vicissitudes they
      passed, and how much we of to-day owe to their devotion and determination.

      Honorable Court would deliver to you the said Manuscript Book on your
      undertaking to use every means in your power for the safe transmission of
      the said Book to the United States of America and its secure deposit and
      custody in the Pilgrim Hall at New Plymouth or in such other place as may
      be selected by the President and Senate of the said United States and upon
      such conditions as to security and access by and on behalf of the English
      Nation as that Honorable Court might determine AND WHEREAS the said
      Petition was set down for hearing on one of the Court days in Hilary Term
      to wit Thursday the Twenty fifth day of March One thousand eight hundred
      and ninety seven in Our Consistorial Court in the Cathedral Church of
      Saint Paul in London before The Right Worshipful Thomas Hutchinson
      Tristram Doctor of Laws and one of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the
      Law Our Vicar General and Official Principal the Judge of the said Court
      and you at the sitting of the said Court appeared by Counsel in support of
      the Prayer of the said Petition and during the hearing thereof the said
      Manuscript Book was produced in the said Court by Our legal <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>Secretary
      and was then inspected and examined by the said Judge and evidence was
      also given before the Court by which it appeared that the Registry at
      Fulham Palace was a Public Registry for Historical and Ecclesiastical
      Documents relating to the Diocese of London and to the Colonial and other
      possessions of Great Britain beyond the Seas so long as the same remained
      by custom within the said Diocese AND WHEREAS it appeared on the face of
      the said Manuscript Book that the whole of the body thereof with the
      exception of part of the last page thereof was in the handwriting of the
      said William Bradford who was elected Governor of New Plymouth in April
      1621 and continued Governor thereof from that date excepting between the
      years 1635 and 1637 up to 1650 and that the last five pages of the said
      Manuscript which is in the handwriting of the said William Bradford
      contain what in Law is an authentic Register between 1620 and 1650 of the
      fact of the Marriages of the Founders of the Colony of New England with
      the names of their respective wives and the names of their Children the
      lawful issue of such Marriages and of the fact of the Marriages of many of
      their Children and Grandchildren and of the names of the issue of such
      marriages and of the deaths of many of the persons named therein And after
      hearing Counsel in support of the said application the Judge being of
      opinion that the said Manuscript <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv"
      id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>Book had been upon the evidence before the
      Court presumably deposited at Fulham Palace sometime between the year 1729
      and the year 1785 during which time the said Colony was by custom within
      the Diocese of London for purposes Ecclesiastical and the Registry of the
      said Consistorial Court was a legitimate Registry for the Custody of
      Registers of Marriages Births and Deaths within the said Colony and that
      the Registry at Fulham Palace was a Registry for Historical and other
      Documents connected with the Colonies and possessions of Great Britain
      beyond the Seas so long as the same remained by custom within the Diocese
      of London and that on the Declaration of the Independence of the United
      States of America in 1776 the said Colony had ceased to be within the
      Diocese of London and the Registry of the Court had ceased to be a public
      registry for the said Colony and having maturely deliberated on the Cases
      precedents and practice of the Ecclesiastical Court bearing on the
      application before him and having regard to the Special Circumstances of
      the Case Decreed as follows&mdash;(1) That a Photographic facsimile
      reproduction of the said Manuscript Book verified by affidavit as being a
      true and correct Photographic reproduction of the said Manuscript Book be
      deposited in the Registry of Our said Court by or on behalf of the
      Petitioner before the delivery to the Petitioner of the said original
      Manuscript Book as hereinafter <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi"
      id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>ordered&mdash;(2) That the said Manuscript
      Book be delivered over to the said Honorable Thomas Francis Bayard by the
      Lord Bishop of London or in his Lordship's absence by the Registrar of the
      said Court on his giving his undertaking in writing that he will with all
      due care and diligence on his arrival from England in the United States
      convey and deliver in person the said Manuscript Book to the Governor of
      the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States of America at his
      Official Office in the State House in the City of Boston and that from the
      time of the delivery of the said Book to him by the said Lord Bishop of
      London or by the said Registrar until he shall have delivered the same to
      the Governor of Massachusetts he will retain the same in his own Personal
      custody&mdash;(3) That the said Book be deposited by the Petitioner with
      the Governor of Massachusetts for the purpose of the same being with all
      convenient speed finally deposited either in the State Archives of the

      order&mdash;(b) That all persons desirous of searching the said Manuscript
      Book for the bona fide purpose of establishing or tracing a Pedigree
      through persons named in the last five pages thereof or in any other part
      thereof shall be permitted to search the same under such safeguards as the

    <h3>
      ADDRESS OF SENATOR HOAR.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first American Ambassador to Great Britain, at the end of his official
      service, comes to Massachusetts on an interesting errand. He comes to
      deliver to the lineal successor of Governor Bradford, in the presence of
      the representatives and rulers of the body politic formed by the compact
      on board the "Mayflower," Nov. 11, 1620, the only authentic history of the
      founding of their Commonwealth; the only authentic history of what we have
      a right to consider the most important political transaction that has ever
      taken place on the face of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bayard has sought to represent to the mother country, not so much the
      diplomacy as the good-will of the American people. If in this anybody be
      tempted to judge him severely, let us remember what his great predecessor,
      John Adams, the first minister at the same court, representing more than
      any other man, embodying more than any other man, the spirit of
      Massachusetts, said to George III., on the first day of June, 1785, after
      the close of our long and bitter struggle for independence: "I shall
      esteem myself the happiest of men if I can be instrumental <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>in restoring
      an entire esteem, confidence and affection, or, in better words, the old
      good-nature and the old good-humor between people who, though separated by
      an ocean and under different governments, have the same language, a
      similar religion and kindred blood."
    </p>
    <p>
      And let us remember, too, the answer of the old monarch, who, with all his
      faults, must have had something of a noble and royal nature stirring in
      his bosom, when he replied: "Let the circumstances of language, religion
      and blood have their natural and full effect."
    </p>
    <p>
      It has long been well known that Governor Bradford wrote and left behind
      him a history of the settlement of Plymouth. It was quoted by early
      chroniclers. There are extracts from it in the records at Plymouth. Thomas
      Prince used it when he compiled his annals. Hubbard depended on it when he
      wrote his "History of New England." Cotton Mather had read it, or a copy
      of a portion of it, when he wrote his "Magnalia." Governor Hutchinson had
      it when he published the second volume of his history in 1767. From that
      time it disappeared from the knowledge of everybody on this side of the
      water. All our historians speak of it as lost, and can only guess what had
      been its fate. Some persons suspected that it was destroyed when Governor
      Hutchinson's house was sacked in 1765, others that it was <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>carried
      off by some officer or soldier when Boston was evacuated by the British
      army in 1776.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1844 Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, afterward Bishop of
      Winchester, one of the brightest of men, published one of the dullest and
      stupidest of books. It is entitled "The History of the Protestant
      Episcopal Church in America." It contained extracts from manuscripts which
      he said he had discovered in the library of the Bishop of London at
      Fulham. The book attracted no attention here until, about twelve years
      later, in 1855, John Wingate Thornton, whom many of us remember as an
      accomplished antiquary and a delightful gentleman, happened to pick up a
      copy of it while he was lounging in Burnham's book store. He read the
      bishop's quotations, and carried the book to his office, where he left it
      for his friend, Mr. Barry, who was then writing his "History of
      Massachusetts," with passages marked, and with a note which is not
      preserved, but which, according to his memory, suggested that the passages
      must have come from Bradford's long-lost history. That is the claim for
      Mr. Thornton. On the other hand, it is claimed by Mr. Barry that there was
      nothing of that kind expressed in Mr. Thornton's note, but in reading the
      book when he got it an hour or so later, the thought struck him for the
      first time that the clew had been found to the precious book which had
      been lost so long. He at once repaired to Charles <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span>Deane, then and ever
      since, down to his death, as President Eliot felicitously styled him, "the
      master of historical investigators in this country." Mr. Deane saw the
      importance of the discovery. He communicated at once with Joseph Hunter,
      an eminent English scholar. Hunter was high authority on all matters
      connected with the settlement of New England. He visited the palace at
      Fulham, and established beyond question the identity of the manuscript
      with Governor Bradford's history, an original letter of Governor Bradford
      having been sent over for comparison of handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the manuscript got to Fulham nobody knows. Whether it was carried over
      by Governor Hutchinson in 1774; whether it was taken as spoil from the
      tower of the Old South Church in 1775; whether, with other manuscripts, it
      was sent to Fulham at the time of the attempts of the Episcopal churches
      in America, just before the revolution, to establish an episcopate here,&mdash;nobody
      knows. It would seem that Hutchinson would have sent it to the colonial
      office; that an officer would naturally have sent it to the war office;
      and a private would have sent it to the war office, unless he had carried
      it off as mere private booty and plunder,&mdash;in which case it would
      have been unlikely that it would have reached a public place of custody.
      But we find it in the possession of the church and of the church official
      having, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>until
      independence was declared, special jurisdiction over Episcopal interests
      in Massachusetts and Plymouth. This may seem to point to a transfer for
      some ecclesiastical purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bishop's chancellor conjectures that it was sent to Fulham because of
      the record annexed to it of the early births, marriages and deaths, such
      records being in England always in ecclesiastical custody. But this is
      merely conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know of no incident like this in history, unless it be the discovery in
      a chest in the castle of Edinburgh, where they had been lost for one
      hundred and eleven years, of the ancient regalia of Scotland,&mdash;the
      crown of Bruce, the sceptre and sword of state. The lovers of Walter
      Scott, who was one of the commissioners who made the search, remember his
      intense emotion, as described by his daughter, when the lid was removed.
      Her feelings were worked up to such a pitch that she nearly fainted, and
      drew back from the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was retiring she was startled by his voice exclaiming, in a tone of
      the deepest emotion, "something between anger and despair," as she
      expressed it: "By God, no!" One of the commissioners, not quite entering
      into the solemnity with which Scott regarded this business, had, it seems,
      made a sort of motion as if he meant to put the crown on the head of one
      of the young ladies near him, but the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span>voice and the aspect of
      the poet were more than sufficient to make this worthy gentleman
      understand his error; and, respecting the enthusiasm with which he had not
      been taught to sympathize, he laid down the ancient diadem with an air of
      painful embarrassment. Scott whispered, "Pray forgive me," and turning
      round at the moment observed his daughter deadly pale and leaning by the
      door. He immediately drew her out of the room, and when she had somewhat
      recovered in the fresh air, walked with her across Mound to Castle Street.
      "He never spoke all the way home," she says, "but every now and then I
      felt his arm tremble, and from that time I fancied he began to treat me
      more like a woman than a child. I thought he liked me better, too, than he
      had ever done before."
    </p>
    <p>
      There have been several attempts to procure the return of the manuscript
      to this country. Mr. Winthrop, in 1860, through the venerable John
      Sinclair, archdeacon, urged the Bishop of London to give it up, and
      proposed that the Prince of Wales, then just coming to this country,
      should take it across the Atlantic and present it to the people of
      Massachusetts. The Attorney-General, Sir Fitzroy Kelley, approved the
      plan, and said it would be an exceptional act of grace, a most interesting
      action, and that he heartily wished the success of the application. But
      the bishop refused. Again, in 1869, John Lothrop <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>Motley, then minister to
      England, who had a great and deserved influence there, repeated the
      proposition, at the suggestion of that most accomplished scholar, Justin
      Winsor. But his appeal had the same fate. The bishop gave no
      encouragement, and said, as had been said nine years before, that the
      property could not be alienated without an act of Parliament. Mr. Winsor
      planned to repeat the attempt on his visit to England in 1877. When he was
      at Fulham the bishop was absent, and he was obliged to come home without
      seeing him in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1881, at the time of the death of President Garfield, Benjamin Scott,
      chamberlain of London, proposed again in the newspapers that the
      restitution should be made. But nothing came of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dec. 21, 1895, I delivered an address at Plymouth, on the occasion of the
      two hundred and seventy-fifth anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims
      upon the rock. In preparing for that duty, I read again, with renewed
      enthusiasm and delight, the noble and touching story, as told by Governor
      Bradford. I felt that this precious history of the Pilgrims ought to be in
      no other custody than that of their children. But the case seemed
      hopeless. I found myself compelled by a serious physical infirmity to take
      a vacation, and to get a rest from public cares and duties, which was
      impossible while I stayed at home. When I went abroad I determined to
      visit the locality, on the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi"
      id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span>borders of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire,
      from which Bradford and Brewster and Robinson, the three leaders of the
      Pilgrims, came, and where their first church was formed, and the places in
      Amsterdam and Leyden where the emigrants spent thirteen years. But I
      longed especially to see the manuscript of Bradford at Fulham, which then
      seemed to me, as it now seems to me, the most precious manuscript on
      earth, unless we could recover one of the four gospels as it came in the
      beginning from the pen of the Evangelist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desire to get it back grew and grew during the voyage across the
      Atlantic. I did not know how such a proposition would be received in
      England. A few days after I landed I made a call upon John Morley. I asked
      him whether he thought the thing could be done. He inquired carefully into
      the story, took down from his shelf the excellent though brief life of
      Bradford in Leslie Stephen's "Biographical Dictionary," and told me he
      thought the book ought to come back to us, and that he should be glad to
      do anything in his power to help. It was my fortune, a week or two after,
      to sit next to Mr. Bayard at a dinner given to Mr. Collins by the American
      consuls in Great Britain. I took occasion to tell him the story, and he
      gave me the assurance, which he has since so abundantly and successfully
      fulfilled, of his powerful aid. I was <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span>compelled, by the
      health of one of the party with whom I was travelling, to go to the
      continent almost immediately, and was disappointed in the hope of an early
      return to England. So the matter was delayed until about a week before I
      sailed for home, when I went to Fulham, in the hope at least of seeing the
      manuscript. I had supposed that it was a quasi-public library, open to
      general visitors. But I found the bishop was absent. I asked for the
      librarian, but there was no such officer, and I was told very politely
      that the library was not open to the public, and was treated in all
      respects as that of a private gentleman. So I gave up any hope of doing
      anything in person. But I happened, the Friday before I sailed for home,
      to dine with an English friend who had been exceedingly kind to me. As he
      took leave of me, about eleven o'clock in the evening, he asked me if
      there was anything more he could do for me. I said, "No, unless you happen
      to know the Lord Bishop of London. I should like to get a sight at the
      manuscript of Bradford's history before I go home." He said, "I do not
      know the bishop myself, but Mr. Grenfell, at whose house you spent a few
      days in the early summer, married the bishop's niece, and will gladly give
      you an introduction to his uncle. He is in Scotland. But I will write to
      him before I go to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday morning brought me a cordial letter from <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span>Mr. Grenfell,
      introducing me to the bishop. I wrote a note to his lordship, saying I
      should be glad to have an opportunity to see Bradford's history; that I
      was to sail for the United States the next Wednesday, but would be pleased
      to call at Fulham Tuesday, if that were agreeable to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got a note in reply, in which he said if I would call on Tuesday he
      would be happy to show me "The Log of the Mayflower," which is the title
      the English, without the slightest reason in the world, give the
      manuscript. I kept the appointment, and found the bishop with the book in
      his hand. He received me with great courtesy, showed me the palace, and
      said that that spot had been occupied by a bishop's palace for more than a
      thousand years.
    </p>
    <p>
      After looking at the volume and reading the records on the flyleaf, I
      said: "My lord, I am going to say something which you may think rather
      audacious. I think this book ought to go back to Massachusetts. Nobody
      knows how it got over here. Some people think it was carried off by
      Governor Hutchinson, the Tory governor; other people think it was carried
      off by British soldiers when Boston was evacuated; but in either case the
      property would not have changed. Or, if you treat it as a booty, in which
      last case, I suppose, by the law of nations ordinary property does change,
      no civilized nation in modern times <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span>applies that principle to
      the property of libraries and institutions of learning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the bishop, "I did not know you cared anything about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said I, "if there were in existence in England a history of King
      Alfred's reign for thirty years, written by his own hand, it would not be
      more precious in the eyes of Englishmen than this manuscript is to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said he, "I think myself it ought to go back, and if it had
      depended on me it would have gone back before this. But the Americans who
      have been here&mdash;many of them have been commercial people&mdash;did
      not seem to care much about it except as a curiosity. I suppose I ought
      not to give it up on my own authority. It belongs to me in my official
      capacity, and not as private or personal property. I think I ought to
      consult the Archbishop of Canterbury. And, indeed," he added, "I think I
      ought to speak to the Queen about it. We should not do such a thing behind
      Her Majesty's back."
    </p>
    <p>
      I said: "Very well. When I go home I will have a proper application made
      from some of our literary societies, and ask you to give it
      consideration."
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw Mr. Bayard again, and told him the story. He was at the train when I
      left London for the steamer at Southampton. He entered with great interest
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span>into the
      matter, and told me again he would gladly do anything in his power to
      forward it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got home I communicated with Secretary Olney about it, who took a
      kindly interest in the matter, and wrote to Mr. Bayard that the
      administration desired he should do everything in his power to promote the
      application. The matter was then brought to the attention of the council
      of the American Antiquarian Society, the Massachusetts Historical Society,
      the Pilgrim Society of Plymouth and the New England Society of New York.
      These bodies appointed committees to unite in the application. Governor
      Wolcott was also consulted, who gave his hearty approbation to the
      movement, and a letter was dispatched through Mr. Bayard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Bishop Temple, with whom I had my conversation, had himself
      become Archbishop of Canterbury, and in that capacity Primate of all
      England. His successor, Rev. Dr. Creighton, had been the delegate of John
      Harvard's College to the great celebration at Harvard University on the
      two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its foundation, in 1886. He had
      received the degree of doctor of laws from the university, had been a
      guest of President Eliot, and had received President Eliot as his guest in
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is an accomplished historical scholar, and very friendly in sentiment
      to the people of the United <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li"
      id="Page_li">[li]</a></span>States. So, by great fortune, the two eminent
      ecclesiastical personages who were to have a powerful influence in the
      matter were likely to be exceedingly well disposed. Dr. Benjamin A. Gould,
      the famous mathematician, was appointed one of the committee of the
      American Antiquarian Society. He died suddenly, just after a letter to the
      Bishop of London was prepared and about to be sent to him for signing. He
      took a very zealous interest in the matter. The letter formally asked for
      the return of the manuscript, and was signed by the following-named
      gentlemen: George F. Hoar, Stephen Salisbury, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel
      A. Green, for the American Antiquarian Society; Charles Francis Adams,
      William Lawrence, Charles W. Eliot, for the Massachusetts Historical
      Society; Arthur Lord, William M. Evarts, William T. Davis, for the Pilgrim
      Society of Plymouth; Charles C. Beaman, Joseph H. Choate, J. Pierpont
      Morgan, for the New England Society of New York; Roger Wolcott, Governor
      of Massachusetts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rarest good fortune seems to have attended every step in this
      transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was fortunate in having formed the friendship of Mr. Grenfell, which
      secured to me so cordial a reception from the Bishop of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate that the Bishop of London was Dr. Temple, an eminent
      scholar, kindly disposed toward the people of the United States, and a man
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span>thoroughly
      capable of understanding and respecting the deep and holy sentiment which
      a compliance with our desire would gratify.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate, too, that Bishop Temple, who thought he must have the
      approbation of the archbishop before his action, when the time came had
      himself become Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of all England.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate that Dr. Creighton had succeeded to the see of London. He
      is, himself, as I have just said, an eminent historical scholar. He has
      many friends in America. He was the delegate of Emmanuel, John Harvard's
      College, at the great Harvard centennial celebration in 1886. He received
      the degree of doctor of laws at Harvard and is a member of the
      Massachusetts Historical Society. He had, as I have said, entertained
      President Eliot as his guest in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate, too, that the application came in a time of cordial
      good-will between the two countries, when the desire of John Adams and the
      longing of George III. have their ample and complete fulfilment. This
      token of the good-will of England reached Boston on the eve of the
      birthday of the illustrious sovereign, who is not more venerated and
      beloved by her own subjects than by the kindred people across the sea.

      of war, the all-shattering guns, the American people are strong enough now
      to look with an entire indifference. We encounter her commerce and her
      manufacture in the spirit of a generous emulation. The inheritance from
      which England has gained these things is ours also. We, too, are of the
      Saxon strain.

      "ever knew the people that she ruled;" the royal nature that disdained to

      bosom of a queen beat with sympathy for the cause of constitutional
      liberty; who, herself not unacquainted with grief, laid on the coffin of

      But I am afraid this application might have had the fate of its
      predecessors but for our special good fortune in the fact that Mr. Bayard
      was our ambassador at the Court of St. James. He had been, as I said in
      the beginning, the ambassador not so much of the diplomacy as of the
      good-will of the American people. Before his powerful influence every
      obstacle gave way. It was almost impossible for Englishmen to refuse a
      request like this, made by him, and in which his own sympathies were so
      profoundly enlisted.

    <p>
      You are entitled, sir, to the gratitude of Massachusetts, to the gratitude
      of every lover of Massachusetts and of every lover of the country. You
      have succeeded where so many others have failed, and where so many others
      would have been likely to fail. You may be sure that our debt to you is
      fully understood and will not be forgotten.

    <p>
      The question of the permanent abiding-place of this <span class="pagenum"><a

      after it has reached the hands of His Excellency. Wherever it shall go it
      will be an object of reverent care. I do not think many Americans will
      gaze upon it without a little trembling of the lips and a little gathering
      of mist in the eyes, as they think of the story of suffering, of sorrow,
      of peril, of exile, of death and of lofty triumph which that book tells,&mdash;which
      the hand of the great leader and founder of America has traced on those
      pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing like it in human annals since the story of Bethlehem.
      These Englishmen and English women going out from their homes in beautiful
      Lincoln and York, wife separated from husband and mother from child in
      that hurried embarkation for Holland, pursued to the beach by English
      horsemen; the thirteen years of exile; the life at Amsterdam "in alley
      foul and lane obscure;" the dwelling at Leyden; the embarkation at
      Delfthaven; the farewell of Robinson; the terrible voyage across the
      Atlantic; the compact in the harbor; the landing on the rock; the dreadful
      first winter; the death roll of more than half the number; the days of
      suffering and of famine; the wakeful night, listening for the yell of wild
      beast and the war-whoop of the savage; the building of the State on those
      sure foundations which no wave or tempest has ever shaken; the breaking of
      the new light; the dawning of the new day; the <span class="pagenum"><a

    <h3>
      ADDRESS OF AMBASSADOR BAYARD.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Your Excellency, Gentlemen of the two Houses of the Legislature of
      Massachusetts, Ladies and Gentlemen, Fellow Countrymen: The honorable and
      most gratifying duty with which I am charged is about to receive its final
      act of execution, for I have the book here, as it was placed in my hands
      by the Lord Bishop of London on April 29, intact then and now; and I am
      about to deliver it according to the provisions of the decree of the
      Chancellor of London, which has been read in your presence, and the
      receipt signed by me and registered in his court that I would obey the
      provisions of that decree.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have kept my trust; I have kept the book as I received it; I shall
      deliver it into the hands of the representative of the people who are
      entitled to its custody.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, gentlemen, it would be superfluous for me to dwell upon the
      historical features of this remarkable occasion, for it has been done, as
      we all knew it would be done, with ability, learning, eloquence and
      impressiveness, by the distinguished Senator who represents you so well in
      the Congress of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[lx]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that related to myself, and for every gracious word of recognition
      and commendation that fell from his lips in relation to the part that I
      have taken in the act of restoration, I am profoundly grateful. It is an
      additional reward, but not the reward which induced my action.
    </p>
    <p>
      To have served your State, to have been instrumental in such an act as
      this, was of itself a high privilege to me. The Bradford manuscript was in
      the library of Fulham palace, and if, by lawful means, I could have become
      possessed of the volume, and have brought it here and quietly deposited
      it, I should have gone to my home with the great satisfaction of knowing
      that I had performed an act of justice, an act of right between two
      countries. Therefore the praise, however grateful, is additional, and I am
      very thankful for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may not be inappropriate or unpleasing to you should I state in a very
      simple manner the history of my relation to the return of this book, for
      it all has occurred within the last twelve months.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew of the existence of this manuscript, and had seen the reproduction
      in facsimile. I knew that attempts had been made, unsuccessfully, to
      obtain the original book.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time Senator Hoar made a short visit to England, and in passing
      through London I was informed by him of the great interest that he, in
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[lxi]</a></span>common
      with the people of this State, had in the restoration of this manuscript
      to the custody of the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      We discussed the methods by which it might be accomplished, and after two
      or three concurrent suggestions he returned to the United States, and
      presently I received, under cover from the Secretary of State,&mdash;a
      distinguished citizen of your own State, Mr. Olney,&mdash;a formal note,
      suggesting rather than instructing that in an informal manner I should
      endeavor to have carried out the wishes of the various societies that had
      addressed themselves to the Bishop of London and the Archbishop of
      Canterbury, in order to obtain the return of this manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      It necessarily had to be done informally. The strict regulations of the
      office I then occupied forbade my correspondence with any member of the
      British government except through the foreign office, unless it were
      informal. An old saying describes the entire case, that "When there's a
      will there's a way." There certainly was the will to get the book, and
      there certainly was also a will and a way to give the book, and that way
      was discovered by the legal custodians of the book itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first there were suggestions of difficulty, some technical questions;
      and following a very safe rule, the first thought was, What is the law?
      and the case was submitted to the law officers of the Crown. <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[lxii]</a></span>Then
      there arose the necessity of a formal act of permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be entertained no question as to the title to the manuscript
      in the possession of the British government. There was no authority to
      grant a claim, founded on adverse title, and the question arose as to the
      requisite form of law of a permissive rather than of a mandatory nature,
      in order to be authoritative with those who had charge of the document.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as I have said, when there was a will there was found a way. By
      personal correspondence and interviews with the Bishop of London, I soon
      discovered that he was as anxious to find the way as I was that he should
      find it. In March last it was finally agreed that I should employ legal
      counsel to present a formal petition in the Episcopal Consistorial Court
      of London, and there before the Chancellor to represent the strong desire
      of Massachusetts and her people for the return of the record of her early
      Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the petition was prepared, and by my authority signed as for
      me by an eminent member of the bar, and it was also signed by the Bishop
      of London, so that there was a complete consensus. The decree was ordered,
      as is published in the London "Times" on March 25 last, and nothing after
      that remained but formalities, in which, as you are well aware, the
      English law is not lacking, especially in the ecclesiastical tribunals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[lxiii]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      These formalities were carried out during my absence from London on a
      short visit to the Continent, and the decree which you have just heard
      read was duly entered on April 12 last, consigning the document to my
      personal custody, to be delivered by me in this city to the high official
      therein named, subject to those conditions which you have also heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, on the 29th of April last I was summoned to the court, and
      there, having signed the receipt, this decree was read in my presence.
      Then the Bishop of London arose, and, taking the book in his hands,
      delivered it with a few gracious words into my custody, and here it is
      to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The records of those proceedings will no doubt be preserved here as
      accompanying this book, as they are in the Episcopal Consistorial Court in
      London, and they tell the entire story.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that is but part. The thing that I wish to impress upon you, and upon
      my fellow countrymen throughout the United States, is that this is an act
      of courtesy and friendship by another government&mdash;the government of
      what we once called our "mother country"&mdash;to the entire people of the
      United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot limit it to the Governor of this Commonwealth; nor to the
      Legislature; nor even to the citizens of this Commonwealth. It extends in
      its courtesy, its kindness and comity to the entire people of the United
      States. From first to last there was <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[lxiv]</a></span>the ready response of
      courtesy and kindness to the request for the restoration of this
      manuscript record.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may say to you that there has been nothing that I have sought more
      earnestly than to place the affairs of these two great nations in the
      atmosphere of mutual confidence and respect and good-will. If it be a sin
      to long for the honor of one's country, for the safety and strength of
      one's country, then I have been a great sinner, for I have striven to
      advance the honor and the safety and the welfare of my country, and
      believed it was best accomplished by treating all with justice and
      courtesy, and doing those things to others which we would ask to have done
      to ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Chancellor pronounced his decree in March last, he cited certain
      precedents to justify him in restoring this volume to Massachusetts. One
      precedent which powerfully controlled his decision, and which in the
      closing portion of his judgment he emphasizes, was an act of generous
      liberality upon the part of the American Library Society in Philadelphia
      in voluntarily returning to the British government some volumes of
      original manuscript of the period of James the First, which by some means
      not very clearly explained had found their way among the books of that
      institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those books were received by a distinguished man, Lord Romilly, Master of
      the Rolls, who took occasion <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv"
      id="Page_lxv">[lxv]</a></span>to speak of the liberality and kindness
      which dictated the action of the Philadelphia library. Gentlemen, I am one
      of those who believe that a generous and kindly act is never unwise
      between individuals or nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The return of this book to you is an echo of the kindly act of your
      countrymen in the city of Philadelphia in 1866.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is that, not, as Mr. Hoar has said, any influence or special effort of
      mine; but it is international good feeling and comity which brought about
      to you the pleasure and the joy of having this manuscript returned, and so
      it will ever be. A generous act will beget a generous act; trust and
      confidence will beget trust and confidence; and so it will be while the
      world shall last, and well will it be for the man or for the people who
      shall recognize this truth and act upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, gentlemen, there is another coincidence that I may venture to point
      out. It is history repeating itself. More than three hundred years ago the
      ancestors from whom my father drew his name and blood were French
      Protestants, who had been compelled to flee from the religious
      persecutions of that day, and for the sake of conscience to find an asylum
      in Holland. Fifty years after they had fled and found safety in Holland,
      the little congregation of Independents from the English village of
      Scrooby, under the pastorate of John Robinson, was forced to fly, and with
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[lxvi]</a></span>difficulty
      found its way into the same country of the Netherlands, seeking an asylum
      for consciences' sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed on. The little English colony removed, as this manuscript of
      William Bradford will tell you, across the Atlantic, and soon after the
      Huguenot family from whom I drew my name found their first settlement in
      what was then the New Netherlands, now New York. Both came from the same
      cause; both came with the same object, the same purpose,&mdash;"soul
      freedom," as Roger Williams well called it. Both came to found homes where
      they could worship God according to their own conscience and live as free
      men. They came to these shores, and they have found the asylum, and they
      have strengthened it, and it is what we see to-day,&mdash;a country of
      absolute religious and civil freedom,&mdash;of equal rights and
      toleration.
    </p>
    <p>
      And is it not fitting that I, who have in my veins the blood of the
      Huguenots, should present to you and your Governor the log of the English
      emigrants, who left their country for the sake of religious freedom?
    </p>
    <p>
      They are blended here,&mdash;their names, their interests. No man asks and
      no man has a right to ask or have ascertained by any method authorized by
      law what is the conscientious religious tenet or opinion of any man, of
      any citizen, as a prerequisite for holding an office of trust or power in
      the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[lxvii]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it well on this occasion to make, as I am sure you are making,
      acknowledgment to that heroic little country, the Lowlands as they call
      it, the Netherlands,&mdash;the country without one single feature of
      military defence except the brave hearts of the men who live in it and
      defend it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holland was the anvil upon which religious and civil liberty was beaten
      out in Europe at a time when the clang was scarcely heard anywhere else.
      We can never forget our historical debt to that country and to those
      people. Puritan, Independent, Huguenot, whoever he may be, forced to flee
      for conscience's sake, will not forget that in the Netherlands there was
      found in his time of need the asylum where conscience, property and person
      might be secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now my task is done. I am deeply grateful for the part that I have
      been enabled to take in this act of just and natural restitution. In
      Massachusetts or out of Massachusetts there is no one more willing than I
      to assist this work; and here, sir [addressing Governor Wolcott], I fulfil
      my trust in placing in your hands the manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      To you, as the honored representative of the people of this Commonwealth,
      I commit this book, in pursuance of my obligations, gladly undertaken
      under the decree of the Episcopal Consistorial Court of London.

    <h3>
      ADDRESS OF GOVERNOR WOLCOTT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      On receiving the volume, Governor Wolcott, addressing Mr. Bayard, spoke as
      follows: I thank you, sir, for the diligent and faithful manner in which
      you have executed the honorable trust imposed upon you by the decree of
      the Consistorial and Episcopal Court of London, a copy of which you have
      now placed in my hands. It was fitting that one of your high distinction
      should be selected to perform so dignified an office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gracious act of international courtesy which is now completed will not
      fail of grateful appreciation by the people of this Commonwealth and of
      the nation. It is honorable alike to those who hesitated not to prefer the
      request and to those whose generous liberality has prompted compliance
      with it. It may be that the story of the departure of this precious relic
      from our shores may never in its every detail be revealed; but the story
      of its return will be read of all men, and will become a part of the
      history of the Commonwealth. There are places and objects so intimately
      associated with the world's greatest men or with mighty deeds that the
      soul of him who gazes upon them is lost in a sense of reverent awe, as it
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[lxxii]</a></span>listens
      to the voice that speaks from the past, in words like those which came
      from the burning bush, "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place
      whereon thou standest is holy ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the sloping hillside of Plymouth, that bathes its feet in the waters of
      the Atlantic, such a voice is breathed by the brooding genius of the
      place, and the ear must be dull that fails to catch the whispered words.
      For here not alone did godly men and women suffer greatly for a great
      cause, but their noble purpose was not doomed to defeat, but was carried
      to perfect victory. They stablished what they planned. Their feeble
      plantation became the birthplace of religious liberty, the cradle of a
      free Commonwealth. To them a mighty nation owns its debt. Nay, they have
      made the civilized world their debtor. In the varied tapestry which
      pictures our national life, the richest spots are those where gleam the
      golden threads of conscience, courage and faith, set in the web by that
      little band. May God in his mercy grant that the moral impulse which
      founded this nation may never cease to control its destiny; that no act of
      any future generation may put in peril the fundamental principles on which
      it is based,&mdash;of equal rights in a free state, equal privileges in a
      free church and equal opportunities in a free school.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this precious volume which I hold in my hands&mdash;the gift of England
      to the Commonwealth of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiii"
      id="Page_lxxiii">[lxxiii]</a></span>Massachusetts&mdash;is told the noble,
      simple story "of Plim&#771;oth Plantation." In the midst of suffering and
      privation and anxiety the pious hand of William Bradford here set down in
      ample detail the history of the enterprise from its inception to the year
      1647. From him we may learn "that all great and honourable actions are
      accompanied with great difficulties, and must be both enterprised and
      overcome with answerable courages."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sadness and pathos which some might read into the narrative are to me
      lost in victory. The triumph of a noble cause even at a great price is
      theme for rejoicing, not for sorrow, and the story here told is one of
      triumphant achievement, and not of defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the official representative of the Commonwealth, I receive it, sir, at
      your hands. I pledge the faith of the Commonwealth that for all time it
      shall be guarded in accordance with the terms of the decree under which it
      is delivered into her possession as one of her chiefest treasures. I
      express the thanks of the Commonwealth for the priceless gift. And I
      venture the prophecy that for countless years to come and to untold
      thousands these mute pages shall eloquently speak of high resolve, great
      suffering and heroic endurance made possible by an absolute faith in the
      over-ruling providence of Almighty God.

      It is well knowne unto y<sup>e</sup> godly and judicious, how ever since y<sup>e</sup>
      first breaking out of y<sup>e</sup> lighte of y<sup>e</sup> gospell in our
      Honourable Nation of England, (which was y<sup>e</sup> first of nations
      whom y<sup>e</sup> Lord adorned ther with, affter y<sup>t</sup> grosse
      darknes of popery which had covered &amp; overspred y<sup>e</sup>
      Christian worled,) what warrs &amp; opposissions ever since, Satan hath
      raised, maintained, and continued against the Saincts, from time to time,
      in one sorte or other. Some times by bloody death and cruell torments;
      other whiles imprisonments, banishments, &amp; other hard usages; as being
      loath his kingdom should goe downe, the trueth prevaile, and y<sup>e</sup>
      churches of God reverte to their anciente puritie, and recover their
      primative order, libertie, &amp; bewtie. But when he could not <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>prevaile by
      these means, against the maine trueths of y<sup>e</sup> gospell, but that
      they began to take rootting in many places, being watered with y<sup>e</sup>
      blooud of y<sup>e</sup> martires, and blessed from heaven with a gracious
      encrease; He then begane to take him to his anciente strategemes, used of
      old against the first Christians. That when by y<sup>e</sup> bloody &amp;
      barbarous persecutions of y<sup>e</sup> Heathen Emperours, he could not
      stoppe &amp; subuerte the course of y<sup>e</sup> gospell, but that it
      speedily overspred with a wounderfull celeritie the then best known parts
      of y<sup>e</sup> world, He then begane to sow errours, heresies, and
      wounderfull dissentions amongst y<sup>e</sup> professours them selves,
      (working upon their pride &amp; ambition, with other corrupte passions
      incidente to all mortall men, yea to y<sup>e</sup> saints them selves in
      some measure,) by which wofull effects followed; as not only bitter
      contentions, &amp; hartburnings, schismes, with other horrible confusions,
      but Satan tooke occasion &amp; advantage therby to foyst in a number of
      vile ceremoneys, with many unproffitable cannons &amp; decrees, which have
      since been as snares to many poore &amp; peaceable souls even to this day.
      So as in y<sup>e</sup> anciente times, the persecutions[2] by y<sup>e</sup>
      heathen &amp; their Emperours, was not greater then of the Christians one
      against other; the Arians &amp; other their complices against y<sup>e</sup>
      orthodoxe &amp; true Christians. As witneseth Socrates in his 2. booke.
      His words are these;<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> <i>The violence truly</i>
      (saith he) <i>was no less than <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5"

      Christians when they were compelled &amp; drawne to sacrifice to idoles;
      for many indured sundrie kinds of tormente, often rackings, &amp;
      dismembering of their joynts; confiscating of ther goods; some bereaved of

      better parte sought, according to y<sup>e</sup> puritie of y<sup>e</sup>

      veiled pretences) for their ouwn ends &amp; advancments, sought as stifly
      to continue, maintaine, &amp; defend. As appeareth by y<sup>e</sup>

      The one side laboured to have y<sup>e</sup> right worship of God &amp;
      discipline of Christ established in y<sup>e</sup> church, according to y<sup>e</sup>
      simplicitie of y<sup>e</sup> gospell, without the mixture of mens
      inventions, and to have &amp; to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7"

      dispensed in those offices, &amp; by those officers of Pastors, Teachers,
      &amp; Elders, &amp;c. according to y<sup>e</sup> Scripturs. The other
      partie, though under many colours &amp; pretences, endevored to have y<sup>e</sup>
      episcopall dignitie (affter y<sup>e</sup> popish man&#773;er) with their
      large power &amp; jurisdiction still retained; with all those courts,
      cannons, &amp; ceremonies, togeather with all such livings, revenues,
      &amp; subordinate officers, with other such means as formerly upheld their
      antichristian greatnes, and enabled them with lordly &amp; tyranous power
      to persecute y<sup>e</sup> poore servants of God. This contention was so
      great, as neither y<sup>e</sup> honour of God, the commone persecution,
      nor y<sup>e</sup> mediation of Mr. Calvin &amp; other worthies of y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord in those places, could prevaile with those thus episcopally minded,
      but they proceeded by all means to disturbe y<sup>e</sup> peace of this
      poor persecuted church, even so farr as to charge (very unjustly, &amp;
      ungodlily, yet prelatelike) some of their cheefe opposers, with rebellion
      &amp; hightreason against y<sup>e</sup> Emperour, &amp; other such crimes.

      against y<sup>e</sup> holy discipline of Christ in his church hath
      continued to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>this

      devices have been used to keepe it out, incensing y<sup>e</sup> queene
      &amp; state against it as dangerous for y<sup>e</sup> com&#773;on wealth;
      and that it was most needfull y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> fundamentall
      poynts of Religion should be preached in those ignorante &amp;
      superstitious times; and to win&#773;e y<sup>e</sup> weake &amp;
      ignorante, they might retaine diverse harmles ceremoneis; and though it
      were to be wished y<sup>t</sup> diverse things were reformed, yet this was
      not a season for it. And many the like, to stop y<sup>e</sup> mouthes of y<sup>e</sup>
      more godly, to bring them over to yeeld to one ceremoney after another,
      and one corruption after another; by these wyles begyleing some &amp;
      corrupting others till at length they begane to persecute all y<sup>e</sup>
      zealous professors in y<sup>e</sup> land (though they knew little what
      this discipline mente) both by word &amp; deed, if they would not submitte
      to their ceremonies, &amp; become slaves to them &amp; their popish trash,
      which have no ground in y<sup>e</sup> word of God, but are relikes of y<sup>t</sup>
      man of sine. And the more y<sup>e</sup> light of y<sup>e</sup> gospell
      grew, y<sup>e</sup> more y<sup>ey</sup> urged their subscriptions to these
      corruptions. So as (notwithstanding all their former pretences &amp; fair
      colures) they whose eyes God had not justly blinded might easily see
      wherto these things tended. And to cast contempte the more upon y<sup>e</sup>
      sincere servants of God, they opprobriously &amp; most injuriously gave
      unto, &amp; imposed upon them, that name of Puritans, which [it] is said

      But that I may come more near my intendmente; when as by the travell &amp;

      other places of y<sup>e</sup> land, so in y<sup>e</sup> North parts, many
      became inlightened by the word of God, and had their ignorance &amp; sins
      discovered unto them, and begane by his grace to reforme their lives, and
      make conscience of their wayes, the worke of God was no sooner manifest in
      them, but presently they were both scoffed and scorned by y<sup>e</sup>
      prophane multitude, and y<sup>e</sup> ministers urged with y<sup>e</sup>
      yoak of subscription, or els must be silenced; and y<sup>e</sup> poore

      notwithstanding, they bore sundrie years with much patience, till they
      were occasioned (by y<sup>e</sup> continuance &amp; encrease of these
      troubls, and other means which the Lord raised up in those days) to see
      further into things by the light of y<sup>e</sup> word of God. How not
      only these base and beggerly ceremonies were unlawfull, but also that y<sup>e</sup>
      lordly &amp; tiranous power of y<sup>e</sup> prelats ought not to be
      submitted unto; which thus, contrary to the freedome of the gospell, would
      load &amp; burden mens consciences, and by their compulsive power make a
      prophane mixture of persons &amp; things in the worship of God. And that
      their offices &amp; calings, courts &amp; cannons, &amp;c. were unlawfull
      and antichristian; being such as have no warrante in y<sup>e</sup> word of
      God; but the same y<sup>t</sup> were used in poperie, &amp; still

      touched w<sup>th</sup> heavenly zeale for his trueth, they shooke of this

      joyned them selves (by a covenant of the Lord) into a church estate, in y<sup>e</sup>

      or to be made known unto them, according to their best endeavours,
      whatsoever it should cost them, the Lord assisting them. And that it cost
      them something this ensewing historie will declare.

      These people became 2. distincte bodys or churches, &amp; in regarde of
      distance of place did congregate severally; for they were of sundrie
      townes &amp; vilages, some in Notingamshire, some of Lincollinshire, and
      some of Yorkshire, wher they border nearest togeather. In one <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>of these
      churches (besids others of note) was Mr. John Smith, a man of able gifts,
      &amp; a good preacher, who afterwards was chosen their pastor. But these
      afterwards falling into some errours in y<sup>e</sup> Low Countries, ther
      (for y<sup>e</sup> most part) buried them selves, &amp; their names.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this other church (w<sup>ch</sup> must be y<sup>e</sup> subjecte of
      our discourse) besids other worthy men, was M<sup>r</sup>. Richard
      Clifton, a grave and rever&#275;d preacher, who by his paines and
      dilligens had done much good, and under God had ben a means of y<sup>e</sup>
      conversion of many. And also that famous and worthy man M<sup>r</sup>.
      John Robinson, who afterwards was their pastor for many years, till y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord tooke him away by death. Also M<sup>r</sup>. William Brewster a
      reverent man, who afterwards was chosen an elder of y<sup>e</sup> church
      and lived with them till old age.

    <p>
      But after these things they could not long continue in any peaceable
      condition, but were hunted &amp; persecuted on every side, so as their
      former afflictions were but as flea-bitings in comparison of these which
      now came upon them. For some were taken &amp; clapt up in prison, others
      had their houses besett &amp; watcht night and day, &amp; hardly escaped
      their hands; and y<sup>e</sup> most were faine to flie &amp; leave their
      howses &amp; habitations, and the means of their livelehood. Yet these
      &amp; many other sharper things which affterward befell them, were no
      other then they looked for, and therfore were y<sup>e</sup> better
      prepared to bear them by y<sup>e</sup> assistance of Gods <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>grace &amp;
      spirite. Yet seeing them selves thus molested, [7] and that ther was no
      hope of their continuance ther, by a joynte consente they resolved to goe
      into y<sup>e</sup> Low-Countries, wher they heard was freedome of Religion
      for all men; as also how sundrie from London, &amp; other parts of y<sup>e</sup>
      land, had been exiled and persecuted for y<sup>e</sup> same cause, &amp;
      were gone thither, and lived at Amsterdam, &amp; in other places of y<sup>e</sup>
      land. So affter they had continued togeither aboute a year, and kept their
      meetings every Saboth in one place or other, exercising the worship of God
      amongst them selves, notwithstanding all y<sup>e</sup> dilligence &amp;
      malice of their adverssaries, they seeing they could no longer continue in
      y<sup>t</sup> condition, they resolved to get over into Holl&#257;d as

      Being thus constrained to leave their native soyle and countrie, their
      lands &amp; livings, and all their freinds &amp; famillier acquaintance,
      it was much, and thought marvelous by many. But to goe into a countrie
      they knew not (but by hearsay), wher they must <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>learne a new language, and get
      their livings they knew not how, it being a dear place, &amp; subjecte to
      y<sup>e</sup> misseries of warr, it was by many thought an adventure
      almost desperate, a case intolerable, &amp; a misserie worse then death.
      Espetially seeing they were not aquainted with trads nor traffique, (by
      which y<sup>t</sup> countrie doth subsiste,) but had only been used to a
      plaine countrie life, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> inocente trade of husbandrey.
      But these things did not dismay them (though they did some times trouble
      them) for their desires were sett on y<sup>e</sup> ways of God, &amp; to
      injoye his ordinances; but they rested on his providence, &amp; knew whom
      they had beleeved. Yet [8] this was not all, for though they could not
      stay, yet were y<sup>e</sup> not suffered to goe, but y<sup>e</sup> ports
      and havens were shut against them, so as they were faine to seeke secrete
      means of conveance, &amp; to bribe &amp; fee y<sup>e</sup> mariners, &amp;
      give exterordinarie rates for their passages. And yet were they often
      times betrayed (many of them), and both they &amp; their goods intercepted
      &amp; surprised, and therby put to great trouble &amp; charge, of which I
      will give an instance or tow, &amp; omitte the rest.

      Ther was a large companie of them purposed to get passage at Boston in
      Lincoln-shire, and for that end had hired a shipe wholy to them selves,
      &amp; made agreement with the maister to be ready at a certaine day, and
      take them and their goods in, at a conveniente place, wher they
      accordingly would all attende <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17"
      id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>in readines. So after long waiting, &amp;
      large expences, though he kepte not day with them, yet he came at length
      &amp; tooke them in, in y<sup>e</sup> night. But when he had them &amp;
      their goods abord, he betrayed them, haveing before hand complotted with y<sup>e</sup>
      serchers &amp; other officers so to doe; who tooke them, and put them into
      open boats, &amp; ther rifled &amp; ransaked them, searching them to their
      shirts for money, yea even y<sup>e</sup> women furder then became
      modestie; and then caried them back into y<sup>e</sup> towne, &amp; made
      them a spectackle &amp; wonder to the multitude, which came flocking on
      all sids to behould them. Being thus first, by the chatch-poule officers,
      rifled, &amp; stripte of their money, books, and much other goods, they
      were presented to y<sup>e</sup> magestrates, and messengers sente to
      informe y<sup>e</sup> lords of y<sup>e</sup> Counsell of them; and so they
      were com&#773;ited to ward. Indeed y<sup>e</sup> magestrats used them
      courteously, and shewed them what favour they could; but could not deliver
      them, till order came from y<sup>e</sup> Counsell-table. But y<sup>e</sup>
      issue was that after a months imprisonmente, y<sup>e</sup> greatest parte
      were dismiste, &amp; sent to y<sup>e</sup> places from whence they came;
      but 7. of y<sup>e</sup> principall were still kept in prison, and bound

      The nexte spring after, ther was another attempte made by some of these
      &amp; others, to get over at an other place. And it so fell out, that they
      light of a Dutchman at Hull, having a ship of his owne belonging <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>to Zealand;
      they made agreemente with him, and acquainted [9] him with their
      condition, hoping to find more faithfullnes in him, then in y<sup>e</sup>
      former of their owne nation. He bad them not fear, for he would doe well
      enough. He was by appointment to take them in betweene Grimsbe &amp; Hull,
      wher was a large com&#773;one a good way distante from any towne. Now
      aganst the prefixed time, the women &amp; children, with y<sup>e</sup>
      goods, were sent to y<sup>e</sup> place in a small barke, which they had
      hired for y<sup>t</sup> end; and y<sup>e</sup> men were to meete them by
      land. But it so fell out, that they were ther a day before y<sup>e</sup>
      shipe came, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> sea being rough, and y<sup>e</sup> women
      very sicke, prevailed with y<sup>e</sup> seamen to put into a creeke
      hardby, wher they lay on ground at lowwater. The nexte morning y<sup>e</sup>
      shipe came, but they were fast, &amp; could not stir till aboute noone. In
      y<sup>e</sup> mean time, y<sup>e</sup> shipe maister, perceiveing how y<sup>e</sup>
      matter was, sente his boate to be getting y<sup>e</sup> men abord whom he
      saw ready, walking aboute y<sup>e</sup> shore. But after y<sup>e</sup>
      first boat full was gott abord, &amp; she was ready to goe for more, the m<sup>r</sup>
      espied a greate company, both horse &amp; foote, with bills, &amp; gunes,
      &amp; other weapons; for y<sup>e</sup> countrie was raised to take them. Y<sup>e</sup>
      Dutch-man seeing y<sup>t</sup>, swore his countries oath, "sacremente,"
      and having y<sup>e</sup> wind faire, waiged his Ancor, hoysed sayles,
      &amp; away. But y<sup>e</sup> poore men which were gott abord, were in
      great distress for their wives and children, which they saw thus to be
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>taken,
      and were left destitute of their helps; and them selves also, not having a
      cloath to shifte them with, more then they had on their baks, &amp; some
      scarce a peney aboute them, all they had being abord y<sup>e</sup> barke.
      It drew tears from their eyes, and any thing they had they would have
      given to have been a shore againe; but all in vaine, ther was no remedy,
      they must thus sadly part. And afterward endured a fearfull storme at sea,
      being 14. days or more before y<sup>ey</sup> arived at their porte, in 7.
      wherof they neither saw son, moone, nor stars, &amp; were driven near y<sup>e</sup>
      coast of Norway; the mariners them selves often despairing of life; and
      once with shriks &amp; cries gave over all, as if y<sup>e</sup> ship had
      been foundred in y<sup>e</sup> sea, &amp; they sinking without recoverie.
      But when mans hope &amp; helpe wholy failed, y<sup>e</sup> Lords power
      &amp; mercie appeared in ther recoverie; for y<sup>e</sup> ship rose
      againe, &amp; gave y<sup>e</sup> mariners courage againe to manage her.
      And if modestie woud suffer me, I might declare with what fervente [10]
      prayres they cried unto y<sup>e</sup> Lord in this great distres,
      (espetialy some of them,) even without any great distraction, when y<sup>e</sup>
      water rane into their mouthes &amp; ears; &amp; the mariners cried out, We
      sinke, we sinke; they cried (if not with mirakelous, yet with a great
      hight or degree of devine faith), Yet Lord thou canst save, yet Lord thou
      canst save; with shuch other expressions as I will forbeare. Upon which y<sup>e</sup>
      ship did not only recover, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20"
      id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>but shortly after y<sup>e</sup> violence of y<sup>e</sup>
      storme begane to abate, and y<sup>e</sup> Lord filed their afflicted minds
      with shuch comforts as every one can&#773;ot understand, and in y<sup>e</sup>
      end brought them to their desired Haven, wher y<sup>e</sup> people came
      flockeing admiring their deliverance, the storme having ben so longe &amp;
      sore, in which much hurt had been don, as y<sup>e</sup> masters freinds
      related unto him in their congrattulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to returne to y<sup>e</sup> others wher we left. The rest of y<sup>e</sup>
      men y<sup>t</sup> were in greatest danger, made shift to escape away
      before y<sup>e</sup> troope could surprise them; those only staying y<sup>t</sup>
      best might, to be assistante unto y<sup>e</sup> women. But pitifull it was
      to see y<sup>e</sup> heavie case of these poore women in this distress;
      what weeping &amp; crying on every side, some for their husbands, that
      were caried away in y<sup>e</sup> ship as is before related; others not
      knowing what should become of them, &amp; their litle ones; others againe
      melted in teares, seeing their poore litle ones hanging aboute them,
      crying for feare, and quaking with could. Being thus aprehended, they were
      hurried from one place to another, and from one justice to another, till
      in y<sup>e</sup> ende they knew not what to doe with them; for to imprison
      so many women &amp; innocent children for no other cause (many of them)
      but that they must goe with their husbands, semed to be unreasonable and
      all would crie out of them; and to send them home againe was as difficult,
      for they aledged, as y<sup>e</sup> trueth was, they had <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>no homes to
      goe to, for they had either sould, or otherwise disposed of their houses
      &amp; livings. To be shorte, after they had been thus turmolyed a good
      while, and conveyed from one constable to another, they were glad to be
      ridd of them in y<sup>e</sup> end upon any termes; for all were wearied
      &amp; tired with them. Though in y<sup>e</sup> mean time they (poore
      soules) indured miserie enough; and thus in the end necessitie forste a
      way for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But y<sup>t</sup> I be not tedious in these things, I will omitte y<sup>e</sup>
      rest, though I might relate many other notable passages and troubles which
      they endured &amp; underwente in these their wanderings &amp; travells
      both at land &amp; sea; but I hast to [11] other things. Yet I may not
      omitte y<sup>e</sup> fruite that came hearby, for by these so publick
      troubls, in so many eminente places, their cause became famouss, &amp;
      occasioned many to looke into y<sup>e</sup> same; and their godly cariage
      &amp; Christian behaviour was such as left a deep impression in the minds
      of many. And though some few shrunk at these first conflicts &amp; sharp
      beginings, (as it was no marvell,) yet many more came on with fresh
      courage, &amp; greatly animated others. And in y<sup>e</sup> end,
      notwithstanding all these stormes of oppossition, they all gatt over at
      length, some at one time &amp; some at an other, and some in one place
      &amp; some in an other, and mette togeather againe according to their
      desires, with no small rejoycing.

    <p>
      Being now come into y<sup>e</sup> Low Countries, they saw many goodly
      &amp; fortified cities, strongly walled and garded with troopes of armed
      men. Also they heard a strange &amp; uncouth language, and beheld y<sup>e</sup>
      differente man&#773;ers &amp; customes of y<sup>e</sup> people, with their
      strange fashons and attires; all so farre differing from y<sup>t</sup> of
      their plaine countrie villages (wherin they were bred, &amp; had so longe
      lived) as it seemed they were come into a new world. But these were not y<sup>e</sup>
      things they much looked on, or long tooke up their thoughts; for they had
      other work in hand, &amp; an other kind of warr to wage &amp; maintaine.
      For though they saw faire &amp; bewtifull cities, flowing with abundance
      of all sorts of welth &amp; riches, yet it was not longe before they saw
      the grim&#773;e &amp; grisly face of povertie coming upon them like an
      armed man, with whom they must bukle &amp; incounter, and from whom they
      could not flye; but they were armed with faith &amp; patience against him,
      and all his encounters; and though they were sometimes foyled, yet by Gods
      assistance they prevailed and got y<sup>e</sup> victorie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when M<sup>r</sup>. Robinson, M<sup>r</sup>. Brewster, &amp; other
      principall <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>members
      were come over, (for they were of y<sup>e</sup> last, &amp; stayed to help
      y<sup>e</sup> weakest over before them,) such things were [12] thought on
      as were necessarie for their setling and best ordering of y<sup>e</sup>
      church affairs. And when they had lived at Amsterdam aboute a year, M<sup>r</sup>.
      Robinson, their pastor, and some others of best discerning, seeing how M<sup>r</sup>.
      John Smith and his companie was allready fallen in to contention with y<sup>e</sup>
      church y<sup>t</sup> was ther before them, &amp; no means they could use
      would doe any good to cure y<sup>e</sup> same, and also that y<sup>e</sup>
      flames of contention were like to breake out in y<sup>t</sup> anciente
      church it selfe (as affterwards lamentably came to pass); which things
      they prudently foreseeing, thought it was best to remove, before they were
      any way engaged with y<sup>e</sup> same; though they well knew it would be
      much to y<sup>e</sup> prejudice of their outward estats, both at presente
      &amp; in licklyhood in y<sup>e</sup> future; as indeed it proved to be.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      <i>Their remoovall to Leyden.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      For these &amp; some other reasons they removed to Leyden, a fair &amp;
      bewtifull citie, and of a sweete situation, but made more famous by y<sup>e</sup>
      universitie wherwith it is adorned, in which of late had been so many
      learned men. But wanting that traffike by sea which Amsterdam injoyes, it
      was not so beneficiall for their outward means of living &amp; estats. But
      being now hear pitchet they fell to such trads &amp; imployments as they
      best <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>could;
      valewing peace &amp; their spirituall comforte above any other riches
      whatsoever. And at lenght they came to raise a competente &amp;
      comforteable living, but with hard and continuall labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being thus setled (after many difficulties) they continued many years in a
      comfortable condition, injoying much sweete &amp; delightefull societie
      &amp; spirituall comforte togeather in y<sup>e</sup> wayes of God, under y<sup>e</sup>
      able ministrie, and prudente governmente of M<sup>r</sup>. John Robinson,
      &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. William Brewster, who was an assistante unto him in y<sup>e</sup>
      place of an Elder, unto which he was now called &amp; chosen by the
      church. So as they grew in knowledge &amp; other gifts &amp; graces of y<sup>e</sup>
      spirite of God, &amp; lived togeather in peace, &amp; love, and holines;
      and many came unto them from diverse parts of England, so as they grew a
      great congregation. And if at any time any differences arose, or offences
      broak[13] out (as it cannot be, but some time ther will, even amongst y<sup>e</sup>
      best of men) they were ever so mete with, and nipt in y<sup>e</sup> head
      betims, or otherwise so well composed, as still love, peace, and communion
      was continued; or els y<sup>e</sup> church purged of those that were
      incurable &amp; incorrigible, when, after much patience used, no other
      means would serve, which seldom came to pass. Yea such was y<sup>e</sup>
      mutuall love, &amp; reciprocall respecte that this worthy man had to his
      flocke, and his flocke to him, that it might be said of them as it once
      was of y<sup>t</sup> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>famouse
      Emperour Marcus Aurelious,<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a

      Rome, that it was hard to judge wheather he delighted more in haveing
      shuch a people, or they in haveing such a pastor. His love was greate
      towards them, and his care was all ways bente for their best good, both
      for soule and body; for besids his singuler abilities in devine things
      (wherin he excelled), he was also very able to give directions in civill
      affaires, and to foresee dangers &amp; inconveniences; by w<sup>ch</sup>
      means he was very helpfull to their outward estats, &amp; so was every way
      as a commone father unto them. And none did more offend him then those
      that were close and cleaving to them selves, and retired from y<sup>e</sup>
      comm&#333;e good; as also such as would be stiffe &amp; riged in matters
      of outward order, and invey against y<sup>e</sup> evills of others, and
      yet be remisse in them selves, and not so carefull to express a vertuous
      conversation. They in like maner had ever a reverente regard unto him,
      &amp; had him in precious estimation, as his worth &amp; wisdom did
      deserve; and though they esteemed him highly whilst he lived &amp;
      laboured amongst them, yet much more after his death, when they came to
      feele y<sup>e</sup> wante of his help, and saw (by woefull experience)
      what a treasure they had lost, to y<sup>e</sup> greefe of their harts, and
      wounding of their sowls; yea such a loss as they saw could not be
      repaired; for it was as hard for them to find such another leader and
      feeder in all respects, as for y<sup>e</sup> Taborits to find another
      Ziska. And though they did not call themselves <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>orphans, as the other did,
      after his death, yet they had cause as much to lamente, in another regard,
      their present condition, and after usage. But to returne; I know not but
      it may be spoken to y<sup>e</sup> honour of God, &amp; without prejudice
      [14] to any, that such was y<sup>e</sup> true pietie, y<sup>e</sup> humble
      zeale, &amp; fervent love, of this people (whilst they thus lived
      together) towards God and his waies, and y<sup>e</sup> single hartednes
      &amp; sinceir affection one towards another, that they came as near y<sup>e</sup>
      primative patterne of y<sup>e</sup> first churches, as any other church of
      these later times have done, according to their ranke &amp; qualitie.
    </p>
    <p>
      But seeing it is not my purpose to treat of y<sup>e</sup> severall
      passages that befell this people whilst they thus lived in y<sup>e</sup>
      Low Countries, (which might worthily require a large treatise of it
      selfe,) but to make way to shew y<sup>e</sup> begining of this plantation,
      which is that I aime at; yet because some of their adversaries did, upon y<sup>e</sup>
      rumore of their removall, cast out slanders against them, as if that state
      had been wearie of them, &amp; had rather driven them out (as y<sup>e</sup>
      heathen historians did faine of Moyses &amp; y<sup>e</sup> Isralits when
      they went out of Egipte), then y<sup>t</sup> it was their owne free choyse
      &amp; motion, I will therfore mention a perticuler or too to shew y<sup>e</sup>
      contrary, and the good acceptation they had in y<sup>e</sup> place wher
      they lived. And first though many of them weer poore, yet ther was none so
      poore, but if they were known to be of y<sup>t</sup> congregation, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>the <i>Dutch</i>
      (either bakers or others) would trust them in any reasonable matter when y<sup>ey</sup>
      wanted money. Because they had found by experience how carfull they were
      to keep their word, and saw them so painfull &amp; dilligente in their
      callings; yea, they would strive to gett their custome, and to imploy them
      above others, in their worke, for their honestie &amp; diligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Againe; y<sup>e</sup> magistrats of y<sup>e</sup> citie, aboute y<sup>e</sup>
      time of their coming away, or a litle before, in y<sup>e</sup> publick
      place of justice, gave this comendable testemoney of them, in y<sup>e</sup>
      reproofe of the Wallons, who were of y<sup>e</sup> French church in y<sup>t</sup>
      citie. These English, said they, have lived amongst us now this 12. years,
      and yet we never had any sute or accusation came against any of them; but
      your strifs &amp; quarels are continuall, &amp;c. In these times allso
      were y<sup>e</sup> great troubls raised by y<sup>e</sup> Arminians, who,
      as they greatly mollested y<sup>e</sup> whole state, so this citie in
      particuler, in which was y<sup>e</sup> cheefe universitie; so as ther were
      dayly &amp; hote disputs in y<sup>e</sup> schooles ther aboute; and as y<sup>e</sup>
      studients &amp; other lerned were devided in their oppinions hearin, so
      were y<sup>e</sup> 2. proffessors or devinitie readers them selves; the
      one daly teaching for it, y<sup>e</sup> other against it. Which grew to
      that pass, that few of the discipls of y<sup>e</sup> one would hear y<sup>e</sup>
      other teach. But M<sup>r</sup>. Robinson, though he taught thrise a weeke
      him selfe, &amp; write sundrie books, besids his manyfould pains
      otherwise, yet he went constantly [15] to hear ther readings, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>and heard y<sup>e</sup>
      one as well as y<sup>e</sup> other; by which means he was so well grounded
      in y<sup>e</sup> controversie, and saw y<sup>e</sup> force of all their
      arguments, and knew y<sup>e</sup> shifts of y<sup>e</sup> adversarie, and
      being him selfe very able, none was fitter to buckle with them then him
      selfe, as appered by sundrie disputs; so as he begane to be terrible to y<sup>e</sup>
      Arminians; which made Episcopius (y<sup>e</sup> Arminian professor) to put
      forth his best stringth, and set forth sundrie Theses, which by publick
      dispute he would defend against all men. Now Poliander y<sup>e</sup> other
      proffessor, and y<sup>e</sup> cheefe preachers of y<sup>e</sup> citie,
      desired M<sup>r</sup>. Robinson to dispute against him; but he was loath,
      being a stranger; yet the other did importune him, and tould him y<sup>t</sup>
      such was y<sup>e</sup> abilitie and nimblnes of y<sup>e</sup> adversarie,
      that y<sup>e</sup> truth would suffer if he did not help them. So as he
      condescended, &amp; prepared him selfe against the time; and when y<sup>e</sup>
      day came, the Lord did so help him to defend y<sup>e</sup> truth &amp;
      foyle this adversarie, as he put him to an apparent nonplus, in this great
      &amp; publike audience. And y<sup>e</sup> like he did a 2. or 3. time,
      upon such like occasions. The which as it caused many to praise God y<sup>t</sup>
      the trueth had so famous victory, so it procured him much honour &amp;
      respecte from those lerned men &amp; others which loved y<sup>e</sup>
      trueth. Yea, so farr were they from being weary of him &amp; his people,
      or desiring their absence, as it was said by some, of no mean note, that
      were it not for giveing offence to y<sup>e</sup> state <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>of England,
      they would have preferd him otherwise if he would, and alowd them some
      publike favour. Yea when ther was speech of their remoovall into these
      parts, sundrie of note &amp; eminencie of y<sup>t</sup> nation would have
      had them come under them, and for y<sup>t</sup> end made them large
      offers. Now though I might aledg many other perticulers &amp; examples of
      the like kinde, to shew y<sup>e</sup> untruth &amp; unlicklyhode of this
      slander, yet these shall suffice, seeing it was beleeved of few, being
      only raised by y<sup>e</sup> malice of some, who laboured their disgrace.

      After they had lived in this citie about some 11. or 12. years, (which is
      y<sup>e</sup> more observable being y<sup>e</sup> whole time of y<sup>t</sup>
      famose truce between that state &amp; y<sup>e</sup> Spaniards,) and

      remedy. In y<sup>e</sup> agitation of their thoughts, and much discours of
      things hear aboute, at length they began to incline to this conclusion, of
      remoovall to some other place. Not out of any newfanglednes, or other such
      like giddie humor, by which men are oftentimes transported to their <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>great hurt
      &amp; danger, but for sundrie weightie &amp; solid reasons; some of y<sup>e</sup>
      cheefe of which I will hear breefly touch. And first, they saw &amp; found
      by experience the hardnes of y<sup>e</sup> place &amp; countrie to be
      such, as few in comparison would come to them, and fewer that would bide
      it out, and continew with them. For many y<sup>t</sup> came to them, and
      many more y<sup>t</sup> desired to be with them, could not endure y<sup>t</sup>
      great labor and hard fare, with other inconveniences which they underwent
      &amp; were contented with. But though they loved their persons, approved
      their cause, and honoured their sufferings, yet they left them as it weer
      weeping, as Orpah did her mother in law Naomie, or as those Romans did
      Cato in Utica, who desired to be excused &amp; borne with, though they
      could not all be Catoes. For many, though they desired to injoye y<sup>e</sup>
      ordinances of God in their puritie, and y<sup>e</sup> libertie of the
      gospell with them, yet, alass, they admitted of bondage, with danger of
      conscience, rather then to indure these hardships; yea, some preferred
      &amp; chose y<sup>e</sup> prisons in England, rather then this libertie in
      Holland, with these afflictions. But it was thought that if a better and
      easier place of living could be had, it would draw many, &amp; take away
      these discouragments. Yea, their pastor would often say, that many of
      those w<sup>o</sup> both wrate &amp; preached now against them, if they
      were in a place wher they might have libertie and live comfortably, they
      would then practise as they did.

      2<sup>ly</sup>. They saw that though y<sup>e</sup> people generally bore
      all these difficulties very cherfully, &amp; with a resolute courage,
      being in y<sup>e</sup> best &amp; strength of their years, yet old age
      began to steale on many of them, (and their great &amp; continuall
      labours, with other crosses and sorrows, hastened it before y<sup>e</sup>
      time,) so as it was not only probably thought, but apparently seen, that
      within a few years more they would be in danger to scatter, by necessities
      pressing them, or sinke under their burdens, or both. And therfore
      according to y<sup>e</sup> devine proverb, y<sup>t</sup> a wise man seeth
      y<sup>e</sup> plague when it cometh, &amp; hideth him selfe, Pro. 22. 3.,
      so they like skillfull &amp; beaten souldiers were fearfull either to be
      intrapped or surrounded by their enimies, so as they should neither be
      able to fight nor flie; and therfor thought it better to dislodge betimes
      to some place of better advantage &amp; less danger, if any such could be
      found. [16] Thirdly; as necessitie was a taskmaster over them, so they
      were forced to be such, not only to their servants, but in a sorte, to
      their dearest chilldren; the which as it did not a litle wound y<sup>e</sup>
      tender harts of many a loving father &amp; mother, so it produced likwise
      sundrie sad &amp; sorowful effects. For many of their children, that were
      of best dispositions and gracious inclinations, haveing lernde to bear y<sup>e</sup>
      yoake in their youth, and willing to bear parte of their parents burden,
      were, often times, so oppressed with their hevie labours, that though
      their minds were free and willing, yet their bodies bowed <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>under y<sup>e</sup>
      weight of y<sup>e</sup> same, and became decreped in their early youth;
      the vigor of nature being consumed in y<sup>e</sup> very budd as it were.
      But that which was more lamentable, and of all sorowes most heavie to be
      borne, was that many of their children, by these occasions, and y<sup>e</sup>
      great licentiousnes of youth in y<sup>t</sup> countrie, and y<sup>e</sup>
      manifold temptations of the place, were drawne away by evill examples into
      extravagante &amp; dangerous courses, getting y<sup>e</sup> raines off
      their neks, &amp; departing from their parents. Some became souldiers,
      others tooke upon them farr viages by sea, and other some worse courses,
      tending to dissolutnes &amp; the danger of their soules, to y<sup>e</sup>
      great greefe of their parents and dishonour of God. So that they saw their
      posteritie would be in danger to degenerate &amp; be corrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, (and which was not least,) a great hope &amp; inward zeall they
      had of laying some good foundation, or at least to make some way therunto,
      for y<sup>e</sup> propagating &amp; advancing y<sup>e</sup> gospell of y<sup>e</sup>
      kingdom of Christ in those remote parts of y<sup>e</sup> world; yea,
      though they should be but even as stepping-stones unto others for y<sup>e</sup>
      performing of so great a work.
    </p>
    <p>
      These, &amp; some other like reasons, moved them to undertake this
      resolution of their removall; the which they afterward prosecuted with so
      great difficulties, as by the sequell will appeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place they had thoughts on was some of those vast &amp; unpeopled
      countries of America, which are frutfull <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>&amp; fitt for habitation,
      being devoyd of all civill inhabitants, wher ther are only salvage &amp;
      brutish men, which range up and downe, litle otherwise then y<sup>e</sup>
      wild beasts of the same. This proposition being made publike and coming to
      y<sup>e</sup> scaning of all, it raised many variable opinions amongst
      men, and caused many fears &amp; doubts amongst them selves. Some, from
      their reasons &amp; hops conceived, laboured to stirr up &amp; incourage
      the rest to undertake &amp; prosecute y<sup>e</sup> same; others, againe,
      out of their fears, objected against it, &amp; sought to diverte from it,
      aledging many things, and those neither unreasonable nor unprobable; as
      that it was a great designe, and subjecte to many unconceivable perills
      &amp; dangers; as, besids the casulties of y<sup>e</sup> seas (which none
      can be freed from) the length of y<sup>e</sup> vioage was such, as y<sup>e</sup>
      weake bodys of women and other persons worne out with age &amp; traville
      (as many of them were) could never be able to endure. And yet if they
      should, the miseries of y<sup>e</sup> land which they should be [17]
      exposed unto, would be to hard to be borne; and lickly, some or all of
      them togeither, to consume &amp; utterly to ruinate them. For ther they
      should be liable to famine, and nakednes, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> wante, in a
      maner, of all things. The chang of aire, diate, &amp; drinking of water,
      would infecte their bodies with sore sickneses, and greevous diseases. And
      also those which should escape or overcome these difficulties, should yett
      be in continuall danger of y<sup>e</sup> salvage people, who are <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>cruell,
      barbarous, &amp; most trecherous, being most furious in their rage, and
      merciles wher they overcome; not being contente only to kill, &amp; take
      away life, but delight to tormente men in y<sup>e</sup> most bloodie man&#773;er
      that may be; fleaing some alive with y<sup>e</sup> shells of fishes,
      cutting of y<sup>e</sup> members &amp; joynts of others by peesmeale, and
      broiling on y<sup>e</sup> coles, eate y<sup>e</sup> collops of their flesh
      in their sight whilst they live; with other cruelties horrible to be
      related. And surely it could not be thought but y<sup>e</sup> very hearing
      of these things could not but move y<sup>e</sup> very bowels of men to
      grate within them, and make y<sup>e</sup> weake to quake &amp; tremble. It
      was furder objected, that it would require greater sum&#773;es of money to
      furnish such a voiage, and to fitt them with necessaries, then their
      consumed estats would amounte too; and yett they must as well looke to be
      seconded with supplies, as presently to be tr&#257;sported. Also many
      presidents of ill success, &amp; lamentable misseries befalne others in
      the like designes, were easie to be found, and not forgotten to be
      aledged; besids their owne experience, in their former troubles &amp;
      hardships in their removall into Holand, and how hard a thing it was for
      them to live in that strange place, though it was a neighbour countrie,
      &amp; a civill and rich comone wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was answered, that all great &amp; honourable actions are accompanied
      with great difficulties, and must be both enterprised and overcome with
      answerable courages. It was granted y<sup>e</sup> dangers were great, but
      not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>desperate;
      the difficulties were many, but not invincible. For though their were many
      of them likly, yet they were not cartaine; it might be sundrie of y<sup>e</sup>
      things feared might never befale; others by providente care &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
      use of good means, might in a great measure be prevented; and all of them,
      through y<sup>e</sup> help of God, by fortitude and patience, might either
      be borne, or overcome. True it was, that such atempts were not to be made
      and undertaken without good ground &amp; reason; not rashly or lightly as
      many have done for curiositie or hope of gaine, &amp;c. But their
      condition was not ordinarie; their ends were good &amp; honourable; their
      calling lawfull, &amp; urgente; and therfore they might expecte y<sup>e</sup>
      blessing of God in their proceding. Yea, though they should loose their
      lives in this action, yet might they have comforte in the same, and their
      endeavors would be honourable. They lived hear but as men in exile, &amp;
      in a poore condition; and as great miseries might possibly befale them in
      this place, for y<sup>e</sup> 12. years of truce were now out, &amp; ther
      was nothing but beating of drumes, and preparing for warr, the events
      wherof are allway uncertaine. Y<sup>e</sup> Spaniard might prove as cruell
      as [18] the salvages of America, and y<sup>e</sup> famine and pestelence
      as sore hear as ther, &amp; their libertie less to looke out for remedie.
      After many other perticuler things answered &amp; aledged on both sids, it
      was fully concluded by y<sup>e</sup> major parte, to put this designe in
      execution, and to prosecute it by the best means they could.

    <p class="center">
      <i>Shewing what means they used for preparation to this waightie vioag.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      And first after thir humble praiers unto God for his direction &amp;
      assistance, &amp; a generall conferrence held hear aboute, they consulted
      what perticuler place to pitch upon, &amp; prepare for. Some (&amp; none
      of y<sup>e</sup> meanest) had thoughts &amp; were ernest for Guiana, or
      some of those fertill places in those hott climats; others were for some
      parts of Virginia, wher y<sup>e</sup> English had all ready made
      enterance, &amp; begining. Those for Guiana aledged that the cuntrie was
      rich, fruitfull, &amp; blessed with a perpetuall spring, and a florishing
      greenes; where vigorous nature brought forth all things in abundance &amp;
      plentie without any great labour or art of man. So as it must needs make y<sup>e</sup>
      inhabitants rich, seing less provisions of clothing and other things would
      serve, then in more coulder &amp; less frutfull countries must be had. As
      also y<sup>t</sup> the Spaniards (having much more then they could
      possess) had not yet planted there, nor any where very near y<sup>e</sup>
      same. But to this it was answered, that out of question y<sup>e</sup>
      countrie was both frutfull and pleasante, and might yeeld riches &amp;
      maintenance to y<sup>e</sup> possessors, more easily then y<sup>e</sup>
      other; yet, other things considered, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>it would not be so fitt for
      them. And first, y<sup>t</sup> such hott countries are subject to greevuos
      diseases, and many noysome impediments, which other more temperate places
      are freer from, and would not so well agree with our English bodys.
      Againe, if they should ther live, &amp; doe well, the jealous Spaniard
      would never suffer them long, but would displante or overthrow them, as he
      did y<sup>e</sup> French in Florida, who were seated furder from his
      richest countries; and the sooner because they should have none to protect
      them, &amp; their owne strength would be too smale to resiste so potent an
      enemie, &amp; so neare a neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      On y<sup>e</sup> other hand, for Virginia it was objected, that if they
      lived among y<sup>e</sup> English w<sup>ch</sup> wear ther planted, or so
      near them as to be under their goverment, they should be in as great
      danger to be troubled and persecuted for the cause of religion, as if they
      lived in England, and it might be worse. And if they lived too farr of,
      they should neither have succour, nor defence from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at length y<sup>e</sup> conclusion was, to live as a distincte body by
      them selves, under y<sup>e</sup> generall Goverment of Virginia; and by
      their freinds to sue to his majestie that he would be pleased to grant
      them freedome of Religion; and y<sup>t</sup> this might be obtained, they
      wear putt in good hope by some great persons, of good ranke &amp;
      qualitie, that were made their freinds. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>Whereupon 2. were chosen [19]
      &amp; sent in to England (at y<sup>e</sup> charge of y<sup>e</sup> rest)
      to sollicite this matter, who found the Virginia Company very desirous to
      have them goe thither, and willing to grante them a patent, with as ample
      priviliges as they had, or could grant to any, and to give them the best
      furderance they could. And some of y<sup>e</sup> cheefe of y<sup>t</sup>
      company douted not to obtaine their suite of y<sup>e</sup> king for
      liberty in Religion, and to have it confirmed under y<sup>e</sup> kings
      broad seale, according to their desires. But it prooved a harder peece of
      worke then they tooke it for; for though many means were used to bring it
      aboute, yet it could not be effected; for ther were diverse of good worth
      laboured with the king to obtaine it, (amongst whom was one of his cheefe
      secretaries,<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>) and some other wrought
      with y<sup>e</sup> archbishop to give way therunto; but it proved all in
      vaine. Yet thus farr they prevailed, in sounding his majesties mind, that
      he would connive at them, &amp; not molest them, provided they carried
      them selves peacably. But to allow or tolerate them by his publick
      authoritie, under his seale, they found it would not be. And this was all
      the cheefe of y<sup>e</sup> Virginia companie or any other of their best
      freinds could doe in the case. Yet they perswaded them to goe on, for they
      presumed they should not be troubled. And with this answer y<sup>e</sup>
      messengers returned, and signified what diligence had bene used, and to
      what issue things were come. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39"
      id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      But this made a dampe in y<sup>e</sup> busines, and caused some
      distraction, for many were afraid that if they should unsetle them selves,
      &amp; put of their estates, and goe upon these hopes, it might prove
      dangerous, and but a sandie foundation. Yea, it was thought they might
      better have presumed hear upon without makeing any suite at all, then,
      haveing made it, to be thus rejected. But some of y<sup>e</sup> cheefest
      thought other wise, and y<sup>t</sup> they might well proceede hereupon,
      &amp; that y<sup>e</sup> kings majestie was willing enough to suffer them
      without molestation, though for other reasons he would not confirme it by
      any publick acte. And furdermore, if ther was no securitie in this promise
      intimated, ther would be no great certainty in a furder confirmation of y<sup>e</sup>
      same; for if after wards ther should be a purpose or desire to wrong them,
      though they had a seale as broad as y<sup>e</sup> house flore, it would
      not serve y<sup>e</sup> turne; for ther would be means enew found to
      recall or reverse it. Seeing therfore the course was probable, they must
      rest herein on Gods providence, as they had done in other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this resolution, other messengers were dispatched, to end with y<sup>e</sup>
      Virginia Company as well as they could. And to procure [20] a patent with
      as good and ample conditions as they might by any good means obtaine. As
      also to treate and conclude with such merchants and other freinds as had
      manifested <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>their
      forwardnes to provoke too and adventure in this vioage. For which end they
      had instructions given them upon what conditions they should proceed with
      them, or els to conclude nothing without further advice. And here it will
      be requisite to inserte a letter or too that may give light to these
      proceedings.

        Our humble duties remembred, in our owne, our messengers, and our

        expressing [21] itselfe, as otherwise, so more spetially in your great
        care and earnest endeavor of our good in this weightie bussines aboute
        Virginia, which y<sup>e</sup> less able we are to requite, we shall

        leade, we will not forbeare to mention these instances of indusmente.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. We veryly beleeve &amp; trust y<sup>e</sup> Lord is with us, unto
        whom &amp; whose service we have given our selves in many trialls; and

        5. Lastly, it is not with us as with other men, whom small things can
        discourage, or small discontentments cause to wish them selves at home
        againe. We knowe our entertainmente in England, and in Holand; we shall
        much prejudice both our arts &amp; means by removall; who, if we should
        be driven to returne, we should not hope to recover our present helps

        y<sup>e</sup> like in any other place during our lives, w<sup>ch</sup>
        are now drawing towards their periods.

        London. Feb: 14.<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1617.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Your letter to S<sup>r</sup>. John Worstenholme I delivered allmost as
        soone as I had it, to his owne hands, and staid with him y<sup>e</sup>
        opening &amp; reading. Ther were 2. papers inclosed, he read them to him
        selfe, as also y<sup>e</sup> letter, and in y<sup>e</sup> reading he
        spake to me &amp; said, Who shall make them? viz. y<sup>e</sup>
        ministers; I answered his Wor<sup>pp</sup> that y<sup>e</sup> power of
        making was in y<sup>e</sup> church, to be ordained by y<sup>e</sup>
        imposition of hands, by y<sup>e</sup> fittest instruments they had. It
        must either be in y<sup>e</sup> church or from y<sup>e</sup> pope, &amp;
        y<sup>e</sup> pope is Antichrist. Ho! said S<sup>r</sup>. John, what y<sup>e</sup>
        pope houlds good, (as in y<sup>e</sup> Trinitie,) that we doe well to
        assente too; but, said he, we will not enter into dispute now. And as
        for your letters he would not show them at any hand, least he should
        spoyle all. He expected you should have been of y<sup>e</sup> archbp&#771;
        minde for y<sup>e</sup> calling of ministers, but it seems you differed.
        I could have wished to have known y<sup>e</sup> contents of <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>your tow
        inclosed, at w<sup>ch</sup> he stuck so much, espetially y<sup>e</sup>
        larger. I asked his Wor<sup>p</sup> what good news he had for me to
        write to morrow. He tould me very good news, for both the kings majestie
        and y<sup>e</sup> bishops have consented. He said he would goe to M<sup>r</sup>.
        Chancelor, S<sup>r</sup>. Fulk Grivell, as this day, &amp; nexte weeke I
        should know more. I mett S<sup>r</sup>. Edw: Sands on Wedensday night;
        he wished me to be at the Virginia Courte y<sup>e</sup> nexte Wedensday,
        wher I purpose to be. Thus loath to be troublsome at present, I hope to
        have somewhate nexte week of certentie concerning you. I com&#773;itte

      [24] These things being long in agitation, &amp; messengers passing too
      and againe aboute them, after all their hopes they were long delayed by
      many rubs that fell in y<sup>e</sup> way; for at y<sup>e</sup> returne of
      these messengers into England they found things farr otherwise then they
      expected. For y<sup>e</sup> Virginia Counsell was now so disturbed with
      factions and quarrels amongst them selves, as no bussines could well goe
      forward. The which may the better appear in one of the messengers letters
      as followeth.

      <p>
        I had thought long since to have write unto you, but could not effecte y<sup>t</sup>
        which I aimed at, neither can yet sett things as I wished; yet,
        notwithstanding, I doubt not but M<sup>r</sup>. B. hath writen to M<sup>r</sup>.
        Robinson. But I thinke my selfe bound also to doe something, least I be
        thought to neglecte you. The maine hinderance of our proseedings in y<sup>e</sup>
        Virginia bussines, is the dissentions and factions, as they terme it,
        amongs y<sup>e</sup> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>Counsell
        &amp; Company of Virginia; which are such, as that ever since we came up
        no busines could by them be dispatched. The occasion of this trouble
        amongst them is, for that a while since S<sup>r</sup>. Thomas Smith,
        repining at his many offices &amp; troubls, wished y<sup>e</sup> Company
        of Virginia to ease him of his office in being Treasurer &amp; Gover<sup>r</sup>.
        of y<sup>e</sup> Virginia Company. Wereupon y<sup>e</sup> Company tooke
        occasion to dismisse him, and chose S<sup>r</sup>. Edwin Sands Treasure<sup>r</sup>
        &amp; Gover<sup>r</sup> of y<sup>e</sup> Company. He having 60. voyces,
        S<sup>r</sup>. John Worstenholme 16. voices, and Alderman Johnsone 24.
        But S<sup>r</sup>. Thomas Smith, when he saw some parte of his honour
        lost, was very angrie, &amp; raised a faction to cavill &amp; contend
        aboute y<sup>e</sup> election, and sought to taxe S<sup>r</sup>. Edwin
        with many things that might both disgrace him, and allso put him by his
        office of Governour. In which contentions they yet stick, and are not
        fit nor readie to intermedle in any bussines; and what issue things will
        come to we are not yet certaine. It is most like S<sup>r</sup>. Edwin
        will carrie it away, and if he doe, things will goe well in Virginia; if
        otherwise, they will goe ill enough allways. We hope in some 2. or 3.
        Court days things will setle. Mean space I thinke to goe downe into
        Kente, &amp; come up againe aboute 14. days, or 3. weeks hence; except
        either by these afforesaid contentions, or by y<sup>e</sup> ille tidings
        from Virginia, we be wholy discouraged, of which tidings I am now to
        speake.
      </p>
      <p>
        Captaine Argoll is come home this weeke (he upon notice of y<sup>e</sup>
        intente of y<sup>e</sup> Counsell, came away before S<sup>r</sup>. Georg
        Yeardley came ther, and so ther is no small dissention). But his tidings
        are ill, though his person be wellcome. He saith M<sup>r</sup>.
        Blackwells shipe came not ther till March, but going towards winter,
        they had still norwest winds, which carried them to the southward beyond
        their course. And y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup> of y<sup>e</sup> ship
        &amp; some 6. of y<sup>e</sup> mariners dieing, it seemed they could not
        find y<sup>e</sup> bay, till after long seeking &amp; beating aboute. M<sup>r</sup>.
        Blackwell is dead, &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Maggner, y<sup>e</sup> Captain;
        yea, ther are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>dead,
        he saith, 130. persons, one &amp; other in y<sup>t</sup> ship; it is
        said ther was in all an 180. persons in y<sup>e</sup> ship, so as they
        were packed togeather like herings. They had amongst them y<sup>e</sup>
        fluxe, and allso wante of fresh water; so as it is hear rather wondred
        at y<sup>t</sup> so many are alive, then that so many are dead. The
        marchants hear say it was M<sup>r</sup>. Blackwells faulte to pack so
        many in y<sup>e</sup> ship; yea, &amp; ther were great mutterings &amp;
        repinings amongst them, and upbraiding of M<sup>r</sup>. Blackwell, for
        his dealing and dispossing of them, when they saw how he had dispossed
        of them, &amp; how he insulted over them. Yea, y<sup>e</sup> streets at
        Gravsend runge of their extreame quarrelings, crying out one of another,
        Thou hast brought me to this, and, I may thanke the for this. Heavie
        newes it is, and I would be glad to heare how farr it will discourage. I
        see none hear discouraged much, [25] but rather desire to larne to
        beware by other mens harmes, and to amend that wherin they have failed.
        As we desire to serve one another in love, so take heed of being
        inthraled by any imperious persone, espetially if they be discerned to
        have an eye to them selves. It doth often trouble me to thinke that in
        this bussines we are all to learne and none to teach; but better so,
        then to depend upon such teachers as M<sup>r</sup>. Blackwell was. Such
        a strategeme he once made for M<sup>r</sup>. Johnson &amp; his people at
        Emden, w<sup>ch</sup> was their subversion. But though he ther clenlily
        (yet unhonstly) plucked his neck out of y<sup>e</sup> collar, yet at
        last his foote is caught. Hear are no letters come, y<sup>e</sup> ship
        captain Argole came in is yet in y<sup>e</sup> west parts; all y<sup>t</sup>
        we hear is but his report; it seemeth he came away secretly. The ship y<sup>t</sup>
        M<sup>r</sup>. Blackwell went in will be hear shortly. It is as M<sup>r</sup>.
        Robinson once said; he thought we should hear no good of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        M<sup>r</sup>. B. is not well at this time; whether he will come back to
        you or goe into y<sup>e</sup> north, I yet know not. For my selfe, I
        hope to see an end of this bussines ere I come, though I am sorie to be
        thus from you; if things had gone roundly forward, <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>I should have been with you
        within these 14. days. I pray God directe us, and give us that spirite
        which is fitting for such a bussines. Thus having sum&#773;arily pointed
        at things w<sup>ch</sup> M<sup>r</sup>. Brewster (I thinke) hath more
        largly write of to M<sup>r</sup>. Robinson, I leave you to the Lords
        protection.

      A word or tow by way of digression touching this M<sup>r</sup>. Blackwell;
      he was an elder of y<sup>e</sup> church at Amsterdam, a man well known of
      most of them. He declined from y<sup>e</sup> trueth w<sup>th</sup> M<sup>r</sup>.
      Johnson &amp; y<sup>e</sup> rest, and went with him when y<sup>ey</sup>
      parted assunder in y<sup>t</sup> wofull maner, w<sup>ch</sup> brought so
      great dishonour to God, scandall to y<sup>e</sup> trueth, &amp; outward
      ruine to them selves in this world. But I hope, notwithstanding, through y<sup>e</sup>
      mercies of y<sup>e</sup> Lord, their souls are now at rest with him in y<sup>e</sup>
      heavens, and y<sup>t</sup> they are arrived in y<sup>e</sup> Haven of
      hapines; though some of their bodies were thus buried in y<sup>e</sup>
      terrable seas, and others sunke under y<sup>e</sup> burthen of bitter
      afflictions. He with some others had prepared for to goe to Virginia. And
      he, with sundrie godly citizens, being at a private me&#275;ing (I take it
      a fast) in London, being discovered, many of them were apprehended, wherof
      M<sup>r</sup>. Blackwell was one; but he so glosed w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup>
      bp&#771;s,<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> and either dissembled or
      flatly denyed y<sup>e</sup> trueth which formerly he had maintained; and
      not only so, but very unworthily betrayed and <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>accused another godly man who
      had escaped, that so he might slip his own neck out of y<sup>e</sup>
      collar, &amp; to obtaine his owne freedome brought others into bonds.
      Wherupon he so wone y<sup>e</sup> bp&#771;s favour (but lost y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord's) as he was not only dismiste, but in open courte y<sup>e</sup>
      arch-bishop gave him great applause and his sollemne blessing to proseed
      in his vioage. But if such events follow y<sup>e</sup> bp&#771;s blessing,
      happie are they y<sup>t</sup> misse y<sup>e</sup> same; it is much better
      to keepe a good conscience and have y<sup>e</sup> Lords blessing, whether
      in life or death.
    </p>
    <p>
      But see how y<sup>e</sup> man thus apprehended by M<sup>r</sup>.
      Blackwells means, writs to a freind of his.

        y<sup>e</sup> matter <i>still continues</i>. I have petitioned <i>twise</i>
        to M<sup>r</sup>. Sherives, and <i>once</i> to my Lord Cooke, and have
        used such reasons to move them to pittie, that if they were not
        overruled by some others, I suppose I should soone gaine my libertie; as
        that I was a yonge man living by my [26] credite, indebted to diverse in
        our citie, living at more then ordinarie charges in a close &amp;
        tedious prison; besids great rents abroad, all my bussines lying still,
        my only servante lying lame in y<sup>e</sup> countrie, my wife being
        also great with child. And yet no answer till y<sup>e</sup> lords of his
        majesties Counsell gave consente. Howbeit, M<sup>r</sup>. Blackwell, a
        man as deepe in this action as I, was delivered at a cheaper rate, with
        a great deale less adoe; yea, with an addition of y<sup>e</sup> Archp&#771;:
        blessing. I am sorie for M<sup>r</sup>. Blackwels weaknes, I <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>wish it
        may prove no worse. But yet he &amp; some others of them, <i>before
        their going</i>, were not sorie, but thought it was for y<sup>e</sup>
        best that I was nominated, not because y<sup>e</sup> Lord sanctifies
        evill to good, but that y<sup>e</sup> action was good, yea for y<sup>e</sup>
        best. One reason I well remember he used was, because this trouble would
        encrease y<sup>e</sup> Virginia plantation, in that now people begane to
        be more generally inclined to goe; and if he had not nomminated some
        such as I, he had not bene free, being it was knowne that diverse
        citizens besids them selves were ther. I expecte an answer shortly what
        they intende conscerning me; I purpose to write to some others of you,
        by whom you shall know the certaintie. Thus not haveing further at
        present to acquaint you withall, com&#773;ending myselfe to your prairs,
        I cease, &amp; com&#773;itte you and us all to y<sup>e</sup> Lord.

      But at last, after all these things, and their long attendance, they had a
      patent granted them, and confirmed under y<sup>e</sup> Companies seale;
      but these devissions and distractions had shaken of many of ther pretended
      freinds, and disappointed them of much of their hoped for &amp; proffered
      means. By the advise of some freinds this pattente was not taken in y<sup>e</sup>
      name of any of their owne, but in y<sup>e</sup> name of Mr. John Wincob (a
      religious gentleman then belonging to y<sup>e</sup> Countess of
      Lincoline), who intended to goe with them. But God so disposed <span

      Upon y<sup>e</sup> receite of these things by one of their messengers,

      [27] After which they concluded both what number and what persons should
      prepare them selves to goe with y<sup>e</sup> first; for all y<sup>t</sup>
      were willing to have gone could not gett ready for their other affairs in
      so shorte a time; neither if all could have been ready, had ther been

      greater number required y<sup>e</sup> pastor to stay with them; and
      indeede for other reasons he could not then well goe, and so it was y<sup>e</sup>

      they should be reputed as members without any further dismission or

      Aboute this time, whilst they were perplexed with y<sup>e</sup>
      proseedings of y<sup>e</sup> Virginia Company, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> ill
      news from thence aboute M<sup>r</sup>. Blackwell &amp; his company, and
      making inquirey about y<sup>e</sup> hiring &amp; buying of shiping for
      their vioage, some Dutchmen made them faire offers aboute goeing with
      them. Also one M<sup>r</sup>. Thomas Weston, a m<sup>r</sup>chant of
      London, came to Leyden aboute y<sup>e</sup> same time, (who was well
      aquainted with some of them, and a furtherer of them in their former
      proseedings,) haveing much conferance w<sup>th</sup> M<sup>r</sup>.
      Robinson &amp; other of y<sup>e</sup> cheefe of them, perswaded them to
      goe on (as it seems) &amp; not to medle with y<sup>e</sup> Dutch, or too
      much to depend on the Virginia Company; for if that failed, if they came
      to resolution, he and such marchants as were his freinds (togeather with
      their owne means) would sett them forth; and they should make ready, and
      neither feare wante of shipping nor money; for what they wanted should be
      provided. And, not so much for him selfe as for y<sup>e</sup> satisfing of
      such frends as he should procure to adventure in this bussines, they were
      to draw such articls of agreemente, and make such propossitions, as might
      y<sup>e</sup> better induce his freinds to venture. Upon which (after y<sup>e</sup>
      formere conclusion) articles were drawne &amp; agreed unto, and were
      showne unto him, and approved by him; and afterwards by their messenger (M<sup>r</sup>.
      John Carver) sent into England, who, togeather with Robart Cushman, were
      to receive y<sup>e</sup> moneys &amp; make provissione both for shiping
      &amp; other things for y<sup>e</sup> vioage; with this <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>charge, not
      to exseede their com&#773;ission, but to proseed according to y<sup>e</sup>
      former articles. Also some were chossen to doe y<sup>e</sup> like for such
      things as were to be prepared there; so those that weare to goe, prepared
      them selves with all speed, and sould of their estats and (such as were
      able) put in their moneys into y<sup>e</sup> commone stock, which was
      disposed by those appointed, for y<sup>e</sup> making of generall
      provissions. Aboute this time also they had heard, both by M<sup>r</sup>.
      Weston and others, y<sup>t</sup> sundrie Hon<sup>bl</sup>: Lords had
      obtained a large grante from y<sup>e</sup> king, for y<sup>e</sup> more
      northerly parts of that countrie, derived out of y<sup>e</sup> Virginia
      patente, and wholy secluded from their Govermente, and to be called by
      another name, viz. New-England. Unto which M<sup>r</sup>. Weston, and y<sup>e</sup>
      cheefe of them, begane to incline it was [28] best for them to goe, as for
      other reasons, so cheefly for y<sup>e</sup> hope of present profite to be
      made by y<sup>e</sup> fishing that was found in y<sup>t</sup> countrie.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as in all bussineses y<sup>e</sup> acting parte is most difficulte,
      espetially wher y<sup>e</sup> worke of many agents must concurr, so it was
      found in this; for some of those y<sup>t</sup> should have gone in
      England, fell of &amp; would not goe; other marchants &amp; freinds y<sup>t</sup>
      had offered to adventure their moneys withdrew, and pretended many
      excuses. Some disliking they wente not to Guiana; others againe would
      adventure nothing excepte they wente to Virginia. Some againe (and those
      that were most relied on) fell in utter dislike with Virginia, and <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>would doe
      nothing if they wente thither. In y<sup>e</sup> midds of these
      distractions, they of Leyden, who had put of their estats, and laid out
      their moneys, were brought into a greate streight, fearing what issue
      these things would come too; but at length y<sup>e</sup> generalitie was
      swaid to this latter opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now another difficultie arose, for M<sup>r</sup>. Weston and some
      other that were for this course, either for their better advantage or
      rather for y<sup>e</sup> drawing on of others, as they pretended, would
      have some of those conditions altered y<sup>t</sup> were first agreed on
      at Leyden. To which y<sup>e</sup> 2. agents sent from Leyden (or at least
      one of them who is most charged with it) did consente; seeing els y<sup>t</sup>
      all was like to be dashte, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> opportunitie lost, and y<sup>t</sup>
      they which had put of their estats and paid in their moneys were in hazard
      to be undon. They presumed to conclude with y<sup>e</sup> marchants on
      those termes, in some things contrary to their order &amp; com&#773;ission,
      and without giving them notice of y<sup>e</sup> same; yea, it was conceled
      least it should make any furder delay; which was y<sup>e</sup> cause
      afterward of much trouble &amp; contention.

        My dear freind &amp; brother, whom with yours I alwaise remember in my

        to God by my best &amp; most earnest praires. You doe throwly understand
        by our generall letters y<sup>e</sup> estate of things hear, which
        indeed is very pitifull; espetialy by wante of shiping, and not seeing
        means lickly, much less certaine, of having it provided; though withall
        ther be great want of money &amp; means to doe needfull things. M<sup>r</sup>.
        Pickering, you know <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>before
        this, will not defray a peny hear; though Robart Cushman presumed of I
        know not how many 100<sup>li</sup>. from him, &amp; I know not whom. Yet
        it seems strange y<sup>t</sup> we should be put to him to receive both
        his &amp; his partners adventer, and yet M<sup>r</sup>. Weston write
        unto him, y<sup>t</sup> in regard of it, he hath drawne upon him a 100<sup>li</sup>.
        more. But ther is in this some misterie, as indeed it seems ther is in y<sup>e</sup>
        whole course. Besids, wheras diverse are to pay in some parts of their
        moneys yet behinde, they refuse to doe it, till they see shiping
        provided, or a course taken for it. Neither doe I thinke is ther a man
        hear would pay any thing, if he had againe his money in his purse. You
        know right well we depended on M<sup>r</sup>. Weston alone, and upon
        such means as he would procure for this commone bussines; and when we
        had in hand another course with y<sup>e</sup> Dutchmen, broke it of at
        his motion, and upon y<sup>e</sup> conditions by him shortly after
        propounded. He did this in his love I know, but things appeare not
        answerable from him hitherto. That he should have first have put in his
        moneys, is thought by many to have been but fitt, but y<sup>t</sup> I
        can well excuse, he being a marchante and haveing use of it to his
        benefite; wheras others, if it had been in their hands, would have
        consumed it. [30] But y<sup>t</sup> he should not but have had either
        shipping ready before this time, or at least certaine means, and course,
        and y<sup>e</sup> same knowne to us for it, or have taken other order
        otherwise, cannot in my conscience be excused. I have heard y<sup>t</sup>
        when he hath been moved in the bussines, he hath put it of from him
        selfe, and referred it to y<sup>e</sup> others;<a name="FNanchor_P_16"
        id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a>
        and would come to Georg Morton, &amp; enquire news of him aboute things,
        as if he had scarce been some accessarie unto it. Wether he hath failed
        of some helps from others which he expected, and so be not well able to
        goe through with things, or whether he hath feared least you should be
        ready too soone &amp; so encrease y<sup>e</sup> charge of shiping above
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>y<sup>t</sup>
        is meete, or whether he have thought by withhoulding to put us upon
        straits, thinking y<sup>t</sup> therby M<sup>r</sup>. Brewer and M<sup>r</sup>.
        Pickering would be drawne by importunitie to doe more, or what other
        misterie is in it, we know not; but sure we are y<sup>t</sup> things are
        not answerable to such an occasion. M<sup>r</sup>. Weston maks himselfe
        mery with our endeavors about buying a ship, but we have done nothing in
        this but with good reason, as I am perswaded, nor yet that I know in any
        thing els, save in those tow; y<sup>e</sup> one, that we imployed Robart
        Cushman, who is known (though a good man, &amp; of spetiall abilities in
        his kind, yet) most unfitt to deale for other men, by reason of his
        singularitie, and too great indifferancie for any conditions, and for
        (to speak truly) that<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a
        href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> we have had nothing from
        him but termes &amp; presumptions. The other, y<sup>t</sup> we have so
        much relyed, by implicite faith as it were, upon generalities, without
        seeing y<sup>e</sup> perticuler course &amp; means for so waghtie an
        affaire set down unto us. For shiping, M<sup>r</sup>. Weston, it should
        seeme, is set upon hireing, which yet I wish he may presently effecte;
        but I see litle hope of help from hence if so it be. Of M<sup>r</sup>.
        Brewer you know what to expecte. I doe not thinke M<sup>r</sup>.
        Pickering will ingage, excepte in y<sup>e</sup> course of buying, in
        former letters specified. Aboute y<sup>e</sup> conditions, you have our
        reasons for our judgments of what is agreed. And let this spetially be
        borne in minde, y<sup>t</sup> the greatest parte of y<sup>e</sup>
        Collonie is like to be imployed constantly, not upon dressing ther
        perticuler land &amp; building houses, but upon fishing, trading, &amp;c.
        So as y<sup>e</sup> land &amp; house will be but a trifell for advantage
        to y<sup>e</sup> adventurers, and yet the devission of it a great
        discouragmente to y<sup>e</sup> planters, who would with singuler care
        make it comfortable with borowed houres from their sleep. The same
        consideration of com&#773;one imploymente constantly by the most is a
        good reason not to have y<sup>e</sup> 2. daies in a weeke denyed y<sup>e</sup>
        few planters for private use, which yet is subordinate to com&#773;one
        good. Consider also how much unfite that you &amp; <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>your liks must serve a new
        prentishipe of 7. years, and not a daies freedome from taske. Send me
        word what persons are to goe, who of usefull faculties, &amp; how many,
        &amp; perticulerly of every thing. I know you wante not a minde. I am
        sorie you have not been at London all this while, but y<sup>e</sup>
        provissions could not wante you. Time will suffer me to write no more;
        fare you &amp; yours well allways in y<sup>e</sup> Lord, in whom I rest.

        <i>An other letter from sundrie of them at y<sup>e</sup> same time.</i>

      <p>
        [31] To their loving freinds John Carver and Robart Cushman, these,
        &amp;c.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good bretheren, after salutations, &amp;c. We received diverse letters
        at y<sup>e</sup> coming of M<sup>r</sup>. Nash &amp; our pilott, which
        is a great incouragmente unto us, and for whom we hop after times will
        minister occasion of praising God; and indeed had you not sente him,
        many would have been ready to fainte and goe backe. Partly in respecte
        of y<sup>e</sup> new conditions which have bene taken up by you, which
        all men are against, and partly in regard of our owne inabillitie to doe
        any one of those many waightie bussineses you referr to us here. For y<sup>e</sup>
        former wherof, wheras Robart Cushman desirs reasons for our dislike,
        promising therupon to alter y<sup>e</sup> same, or els saing we should
        thinke he hath no brains, we desire him to exercise them therin,
        refering him to our pastors former reasons, and them to y<sup>e</sup>
        censure of y<sup>e</sup> godly wise. But our desires are that you will
        not entangle your selvs and us in any such unreasonable courses as those
        are, viz. y<sup>t</sup> the marchants should have y<sup>e</sup> halfe of
        mens houses and lands at y<sup>e</sup> dividente; and that persons
        should be deprived of y<sup>e</sup> 2. days in a weeke agreed upon, yea
        every momente of time for their owne perticuler; by reason wherof we
        cannot conceive why any should carie servants for their own help and
        comfort; for that we can require no more <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>of them then all men one of
        another. This we have only by relation from M<sup>r</sup>. Nash, &amp;
        not from any writing of your owne, &amp; therfore hope you have not
        proceeded farr in so great a thing without us. But requiring you not to
        exseed the bounds of your com&#773;ission, which was to proceed upon y<sup>e</sup>
        things or conditions agred upon and expressed in writing (at your going
        over about it), we leave it, not without marveling, that you<sup>r</sup>
        selfe, as you write, knowing how smale a thing troubleth our
        consultations, and how few, as you fear, understands the busnes aright,
        should trouble us with such matters as these are, &amp;c.
      </p>
      <p>
        Salute M<sup>r</sup>. Weston from us, in whom we hope we are not
        deceived; we pray you make known our estate unto him, and if you thinke
        good shew him our letters, at least tell him (y<sup>t</sup> under God)
        we much relie upon him &amp; put our confidence in him; and, as your
        selves well know, that if he had not been an adventurer with us, we had
        not taken it in hand; presuming that if he had not seene means to
        accomplish it, he would not have begune it; so we hope in our extremitie
        he will so farr help us as our expectation be no way made frustrate
        concerning him. Since therfore, good brethren, we have plainly opened y<sup>e</sup>
        state of things with us in this matter, you will, &amp;c. Thus
        beseeching y<sup>e</sup> Allmightie, who is allsufficiente to raise us
        out of this depth of dificulties, to assiste us herein; raising such
        means by his providence and fatherly care for us, his pore children
        &amp; servants, as we may with comforte behould y<sup>e</sup> hand of
        our God for good towards us in this our bussines, which we undertake in

        <i>A letter of Robart Cushmans to them.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Brethern, I understand by letters &amp; passagess y<sup>t</sup> have
        come to me, that ther are great discontents, &amp; dislike of my
        proceedings amongst you. Sorie I am to hear it, yet contente to beare
        it, as not doubting but y<sup>t</sup> partly by writing, and more
        principally by word when we shall come togeather, I shall satisfie any
        reasonable man. I have been perswaded [32] by some, espetialy this
        bearer, to come and clear things unto you; but as things now stand I can&#773;ot
        be absente one day, excepte I should hazard all y<sup>e</sup> viage.
        Neither conceive I any great good would come of it. Take then, brethern,
        this as a step to give you contente. First, for your dislike of y<sup>e</sup>
        alteration of one clause in y<sup>e</sup> conditions, if you conceive it
        right, ther can be no blame lye on me at all. For y<sup>e</sup> articles
        first brought over by John Carver were never seene of any of y<sup>e</sup>
        adventurers hear, excepte M<sup>r</sup>. Weston, neither did any of them
        like them because of that clause; nor M<sup>r</sup>. Weston him selfe,
        after he had well considered it. But as at y<sup>e</sup> first ther was
        500<sup>li</sup>. withdrawne by S<sup>r</sup>. Georg Farrer and his
        brother upon that dislike, so all y<sup>e</sup> rest would have
        withdrawne (M<sup>r</sup>. Weston excepted) if we had not altered y<sup>t</sup>
        clause. Now whilst we at Leyden conclude upon points, as we did, we
        reckoned without our host, which was not my falte. Besids, I shewed you
        by a letter y<sup>e</sup> equitie of y<sup>t</sup> condition, &amp; our
        inconveniences, which might be sett against all M<sup>r</sup>. Rob:
        inconveniences, that without y<sup>e</sup> alteration of y<sup>t</sup>
        clause, we could neither have means to gett thither, nor supplie wherby
        to subsiste when we were ther. Yet notwithstanding all those reasons,
        which were not mine, but other mens wiser then my selfe, without answer
        to any one of them, here cometh over many quirimonies, and complaints
        against me, of lording it over my brethern, and making conditions fitter
        for theeves &amp; bondslaves then honest men, and that of my owne head I
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>did
        what I list. And at last a paper of reasons, framed against y<sup>t</sup>
        clause in y<sup>e</sup> conditions, which as y<sup>ey</sup> were
        delivered me open, so my answer is open to you all. And first, as they
        are no other but inconveniences, such as a man might frame 20. as great
        on y<sup>e</sup> other side, and yet prove nor disprove nothing by them,
        so they misse &amp; mistake both y<sup>e</sup> very ground of y<sup>e</sup>
        article and nature of y<sup>e</sup> project. For, first, it is said,
        that if ther had been no divission of houses &amp; lands, it had been
        better for y<sup>e</sup> poore. True, and y<sup>t</sup> showeth y<sup>e</sup>
        inequalitie of y<sup>e</sup> condition; we should more respecte him y<sup>t</sup>
        ventureth both his money and his person, then him y<sup>t</sup>
        ventureth but his person only.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Consider wheraboute we are, not giveing almes, but furnishing a store
        house; no one shall be porer then another for 7. years, and if any be
        rich, none can be pore. At y<sup>e</sup> least, we must not in such
        bussines crie, Pore, pore, mercie, mercie. Charitie hath it life in
        wraks, not in venturs; you are by this most in a hopefull pitie of
        makeing, therfore complaine not before you have need.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. This will hinder y<sup>e</sup> building of good and faire houses,
        contrarie to y<sup>e</sup> advise of pollitiks. A. So we would have it;
        our purpose is to build for y<sup>e</sup> presente such houses as, if
        need be, we may with litle greefe set a fire, and rune away by the
        lighte; our riches shall not be in pompe, but in strenght; if God send
        us riches, we will imploye them to provid more men, ships, munition,
        &amp;c. You may see it amongst the best pollitiks, that a com&#773;onwele
        is readier to ebe then to flow, when once fine houses and gay cloaths
        come up.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. The Gove<sup>t</sup> may prevente excess in building. A. But if it be
        on all men beforehand resolved on, to build mean houses, y<sup>e</sup>
        Gove<sup>r</sup> laboure is spared.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. All men are not of one condition. A. If by condition you mean wealth,
        you are mistaken; if you mean by condition, qualities, then I say he
        that is not contente his neighbour shall have as good a house, fare,
        means, &amp;c. as him selfe, is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65"
        id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>not of a good qualitie. 2<sup>ly</sup>. Such
        retired persons, as have aneie only to them selves, are fitter to come
        wher catching is, then closing; and are fitter to live alone, then in
        any societie, either civill or religious.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. It will be of litle value, scarce worth 5<sup>li</sup>. A. True, it
        may be not worth halfe 5<sup>li</sup>. [33] If then so smale a thing
        will content them, why strive we thus aboute it, and give them occasion
        to suspecte us to be worldly &amp; covetous? I will not say what I have
        heard since these complaints came first over.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Our freinds with us y<sup>t</sup> adventure mind not their owne
        profite, as did y<sup>e</sup> old adventurers. A. Then they are better
        then we, who for a litle matter of profite are readie to draw back, and
        it is more apparente brethern looke too it, that make profite your maine
        end; repente of this, els goe not least you be like Jonas to Tarshis. 2<sup>ly</sup>.
        Though some of them mind not their profite, yet others doe mind it; and
        why not as well as we? venturs are made by all sorts of men, and we must
        labour to give them all contente, if we can.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. It will break y<sup>e</sup> course of com&#773;unitie, as may be
        showed by many reasons. A. That is but said, and I say againe, it will
        best foster comunion, as may be showed by many reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        9. Great profite is like to be made by trucking, fishing, &amp;c. A. As
        it is better for them, so for us; for halfe is ours, besids our living
        still upon it, and if such profite in y<sup>t</sup> way come, our labour
        shall be y<sup>e</sup> less on y<sup>e</sup> land, and our houses and
        lands must &amp; will be of less value.
      </p>
      <p>
        10. Our hazard is greater then theirs. A. True, but doe they put us upon
        it? doe they urge or egg us? hath not y<sup>e</sup> motion &amp;
        resolution been always in our selves? doe they any more then in seeing
        us resolute if we had means, help us to means upon equall termes &amp;
        conditions? If we will not goe, they are content to keep their moneys.
        Thus I have pointed at a way to loose those knots, which I hope you will
        consider seriously, and let me have no more stirre about them. <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now furder, I hear a noise of slavish conditions by me made; but surly
        this is all that I have altered, and reasons I have sent you. If you
        mean it of y<sup>e</sup> 2. days in a week for perticuler, as some
        insinuate, you are deceived; you may have 3. days in a week for me if
        you will. And when I have spoken to y<sup>e</sup> adventurers of times
        of working, they have said they hope we are men of discretion &amp;
        conscience, and so fitte to be trusted our selves with that. But indeed
        y<sup>e</sup> ground of our proceedings at Leyden was mistaken, and so
        here is nothing but tottering every day, &amp;c.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for them of Amsterdam I had thought they would as soone have gone to
        Rome as with us; for our libertie is to them as ratts bane, and their
        riggour as bad to us as y<sup>e</sup> Spanish Inquision. If any practise
        of mine discourage them, let them yet draw back; I will undertake they
        shall have their money againe presently paid hear. Or if the company
        thinke me to be y<sup>e</sup> Jonas, let them cast me of before we goe;
        I shall be content to stay with good will, having but the cloaths on my
        back; only let us have quietnes, and no more of these clamors; full
        litle did I expecte these things which are now come to pass, &amp;c.
      </p>

      But whether this letter of his ever came to their hands at Leyden I well
      know not; I rather thinke it was staied by M<sup>r</sup>. Carver &amp;
      kept by him, forgiving offence. But this which follows was ther received;
      both which I thought pertenent to recite.

        Salutations, &amp;c. I received your l&#7869;r. yesterday, by John
        Turner, with another y<sup>e</sup> same day from Amsterdam by M<sup>r</sup>.
        W. savouring of y<sup>e</sup> place whenc it came. And indeed the many
        discouragements I find her, togeather with y<sup>e</sup> demurrs and
        retirings ther, had made me to say, I would give up my accounts to John
        Carver, &amp; at his comeing aquainte him fully with all courses, and so
        leave it quite, with only y<sup>e</sup> pore cloaths on my back. But
        gathering up my selfe by further consideration, [34] I resolved yet to
        make one triall more, and to aquainte M<sup>r</sup>. Weston with y<sup>e</sup>
        fainted state of our bussines; and though he hath been much discontented
        at some thing amongst us of late, which hath made him often say, that
        save for his promise, he would not meadle at all with y<sup>e</sup>
        bussines any more, yet considering how farr we were plunged into maters,
        &amp; how it stood both on our credits &amp; undoing, at y<sup>e</sup>
        last he gathered up him selfe a litle more, &amp; coming to me 2. hours
        after, he tould me he would not yet leave it. And so advising togeather
        we resolved to hire a ship, and have tooke liking of one till Monday,
        about 60. laste, for a greater we cannot gett, excepte it be tow great;
        but a fine ship it is. And seeing our neer freinds ther are so streite
        lased, we hope to assure her without troubling them any further; and if
        y<sup>e</sup> ship fale too small, it fitteth well y<sup>t</sup> such as
        stumble at strawes allready, may rest them ther a while, least worse
        blocks come in y<sup>e</sup> way ere 7. years be ended. If you had
        beaten this bussines so throuly a month agoe, and write to us as now you
        doe, we could thus have done much more conveniently. But it is as it is;
        I hope our freinds ther, if they be quitted of the ship hire, will be
        indusced to venture y<sup>e</sup> more. All y<sup>t</sup> I now require
        is y<sup>t</sup> salt and netts may ther be boughte, and for all y<sup>e</sup>
        rest we will here provid it; yet if that will not be, let them but stand
        for it a month or tow, and we will take order to pay it all. Let M<sup>r</sup>.
        <i>Reinholds</i> tarie ther, and bring y<sup>e</sup> ship to
        Southampton. We have hired another pilote here, one M<sup>r</sup>. <i>Clarke</i>,
        who went last year to Virginia with a ship of kine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> You
        shall here distinctly by John Turner, who I thinke shall come hence on
        Tewsday night. I had thought to have come with him, to have answerd to
        my complaints; but I shal lerne to pass litle for their censurs; and if
        I had more minde to goe &amp; dispute &amp; expostulate with them, then
        I have care of this waightie bussines, I were like them who live by
        clamours &amp; jangling. But neither my mind nor my body is at libertie
        to doe much, for I am fettered with bussines, and had rather study to be
        quiet, then to make answer to their exceptions. If men be set on it, let
        them beat y<sup>e</sup> eair; I hope such as are my sinceire freinds
        will not thinke but I can give some reason of my actions. But of your
        mistaking aboute y<sup>e</sup> mater, &amp; other things tending to this
        bussines, I shall nexte informe you more distinctly. Mean space entreate
        our freinds not to be too bussie in answering matters, before they know
        them. If I doe such things as I can&#773;ot give reasons for, it is like
        you have sett a foole aboute your bussines, and so turne y<sup>e</sup>
        reproofe to your selves, &amp; send an other, and let me come againe to
        my Combes. But setting a side my naturall infirmities, I refuse not to
        have my cause judged, both of God, &amp; all indifferent men; and when
        we come togeather I shall give accounte of my actions hear. The Lord,
        who judgeth justly without respect of persons, see into y<sup>e</sup>
        equitie of my cause, and give us quiet, peacable, and patient minds, in
        all these turmoiles, and sanctifie unto us all crosses whatsoever. And
        so I take my leave of you all, in all love &amp; affection.

      Besids these things, ther fell out a differance amongs those 3. that
      received [35] the moneys &amp; made y<sup>e</sup> provissions in England;
      for besids these tow formerly mentioned <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>sent from Leyden for this end,
      viz. M<sup>r</sup>. Carver &amp; Robart Cushman, ther was one chosen in
      England to be joyned with them, to make y<sup>e</sup> provisions for y<sup>e</sup>
      vioage; his name was M<sup>r</sup>. Martin, he came from Billirike in
      Essexe, from which parts came sundrie others to goe with them, as also
      from London &amp; other places; and therfore it was thought meete &amp;
      conveniente by them in Holand that these strangers that were to goe with
      them, should apointe one thus to be joyned with them, not so much for any
      great need of their help, as to avoyd all susspition, or jelosie of any
      partiallitie. And indeed their care for giving offence, both in this &amp;
      other things afterward, turned to great inconvenience unto them, as in y<sup>e</sup>
      sequell will apeare; but however it shewed their equall &amp; honest
      minds. The provissions were for y<sup>e</sup> most parte made at
      Southhamton, contrarie to M<sup>r</sup>. Westons &amp; Robert Cushm&#257;s
      mind (whose counsells did most concure in all things). A touch of which
      things I shall give in a letter of his to M<sup>r</sup>. Carver, and more
      will appear afterward.

        To his loving freind M<sup>r</sup>. John Carver, these, &amp;c.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loving freind, I have received from you some letters, full of affection
        &amp; complaints, and what it is you would have of me I know not; for
        your crieing out, Negligence, negligence, negligence, I marvell why so
        negligente a man was used in y<sup>e</sup> bussines. Yet know you y<sup>t</sup>
        all that I have power to doe hear, shall not be one hower behind, I
        warent you. You have reference to M<sup>r</sup>. Weston to help us with
        money, more then his adventure; wher he protesteth but for his promise,
        he would <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>not
        have done any thing. He saith we take a heady course, and is offended y<sup>t</sup>
        our provissions are made so farr of; as also that he was not made
        aquainted with our quantitie of things; and saith y<sup>t</sup> in now
        being in 3. places, so farr remote, we will, with going up &amp; downe,
        and wrangling &amp; expostulating, pass over y<sup>e</sup> som&#773;er
        before we will goe. And to speake y<sup>e</sup> trueth, ther is fallen
        already amongst us a flatt schisme; and we are redier to goe to dispute,
        then to sett forwarde a voiage. I have received from Leyden since you
        wente 3. or 4. letters directed to you, though they only conscerne me. I
        will not trouble you with them. I always feared y<sup>e</sup> event of y<sup>e</sup>
        Amsterdamers striking in with us. I trow you must excom&#773;unicate me,
        or els you must goe without their companie, or we shall wante no
        quareling; but let them pass. We have reckoned, it should seeme, without
        our host; and, counting upon a 150. persons, ther cannot be founde above
        1200<sup>li</sup>. &amp; odd moneys of all y<sup>e</sup> venturs you can
        reckone, besids some cloath, stockings, &amp; shoes, which are not
        counted; so we shall come shorte at least 3. or 400<sup>li</sup>. I
        would have had some thing shortened at first of beare &amp; other
        provissions in hope of other adventurs, &amp; now we could have, both in
        Amsterd: &amp; Kente, beere inough to serve our turne, but now we cannot
        accept it without prejudice. You fear we have begune to build &amp;
        shall not be able to make an end; indeed, our courses were never
        established by counsell, we may therfore justly fear their standing.
        Yea, ther was a [36] schisme amongst us 3. at y<sup>e</sup> first. You
        wrote to M<sup>r</sup>. Martin, to prevente y<sup>e</sup> making of y<sup>e</sup>
        provissions in Kente, which he did, and sett downe his resolution how
        much he would have of every thing, without respecte to any counsell or
        exception. Surely he y<sup>t</sup> is in a societie &amp; yet regards
        not counsell, may better be a king then a consorte. To be short, if ther
        be not some other dispossition setled unto then yet is, we y<sup>t</sup>
        should be partners of humilitie and peace, shall be examples of jangling
        &amp; insulting. Yet your money which you ther must <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>have, we will get provided
        for you instantly. 500<sup>li</sup>. you say will serve; for y<sup>e</sup>
        rest which hear &amp; in Holand is to be used, we may goe scratch for
        it. For M<sup>r</sup>.<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a
        href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a> Crabe, of whom you write,
        he hath promised to goe with us, yet I tell you I shall not be without
        feare till I see him shipped, for he is much opposed, yet I hope he will
        not faile. Thinke y<sup>e</sup> best of all, and bear with patience what
        is wanting, and y<sup>e</sup> Lord guid us all.

      their arivall at South hamton, were they all mete togeather, and tooke in
      ther provissions.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after much travell and these debats, all things were got ready
      and provided. A smale ship<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>was bought, &amp; fitted in
      Holand, which was intended as to serve to help to transport them, so to
      stay in y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie and atend upon fishing and shuch other
      affairs as might be for y<sup>e</sup> good &amp; benefite of y<sup>e</sup>
      colonie when they came ther. Another was hired at London, of burden about
      9. score; and all other things gott in readines. So being ready to
      departe, they had a day of solleme humiliation, their pastor taking his
      texte from Ezra 8. 21. <i>And ther at y<sup>e</sup> river, by Ahava, I
      proclaimed a fast, that we might humble ourselves before our God, and
      seeke of him a right way for us, and for our children, and for all our
      substance.</i> Upon which he spente a good parte of y<sup>e</sup> day very
      profitably, and suitable to their presente occasion. The rest of the time
      was spente in powering out prairs to y<sup>e</sup> Lord with great
      fervencie, mixed with abundance of tears. And y<sup>e</sup> time being
      come that they must departe, they were accompanied with most of their
      brethren out of y<sup>e</sup> citie, unto a towne sundrie miles of called
      Delfes-Haven, wher the ship lay ready to receive them. So they lefte y<sup>t</sup>
      goodly &amp; pleasante citie, which had been ther resting place near 12.
      years; but they knew they were pilgrimes,<a name="FNanchor_V_22"
      id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a>
      &amp; looked not much on those things, but lift up their eyes to y<sup>e</sup>
      heavens, their dearest cuntrie, and quieted their spirits. When they [37]
      came to y<sup>e</sup> place they found y<sup>e</sup> ship and all things
      ready; and shuch of their freinds as could not come with them <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>followed
      after them, and sundrie also came from Amsterdame to see them shipte and
      to take their leave of them. That night was spent with litle sleepe by y<sup>e</sup>
      most, but with freindly entertainmente &amp; christian discourse and other
      reall expressions of true christian love. The next day, the wind being
      faire, they wente aborde, and their freinds with them, where truly dolfull
      was y<sup>e</sup> sight of that sade and mournfull parting; to see what
      sighs and sobbs and praires did sound amongst them, what tears did gush
      from every eye, &amp; pithy speeches peirst each harte; that sundry of y<sup>e</sup>
      Dutch strangers y<sup>t</sup> stood on y<sup>e</sup> key as spectators,
      could not refraine from tears. Yet comfortable &amp; sweete it was to see
      shuch lively and true expressions of clear &amp; unfained love. But the
      tide (which stays for no man) caling them away y<sup>t</sup> were thus
      loath to departe, their Rev&#771;&#275;<sup>d</sup>: pastor falling downe
      on his knees, (and they all with him,) with watrie cheeks com&#773;ended
      them with most fervente praiers to the Lord and his blessing. And then
      with mutuall imbrases and many tears, they tooke their leaves one of an
      other; which proved to be y<sup>e</sup> last leave to many of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus hoysing saile,<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a> with a prosperus winde they
      came in short time to Southhamton, wher they found the bigger ship come
      from London, lying ready, w<sup>th</sup> all the rest of their company.
      After a joyfull wellcome, and mutuall congratulations, with other frendly
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>entertainements,
      they fell to parley aboute their bussines, how to dispatch with y<sup>e</sup>
      best expedition; as allso with their agents, aboute y<sup>e</sup>
      alteration of y<sup>e</sup> conditions. M<sup>r</sup>. Carver pleaded he
      was imployed hear at Hamton, and knew not well what y<sup>e</sup> other
      had don at London. M<sup>r</sup>. Cushman answered, he had done nothing
      but what he was urged too, partly by y<sup>e</sup> grounds of equity, and
      more espetialy by necessitie, other wise all had bene dasht and many
      undon. And in y<sup>e</sup> begining he aquainted his felow agents here
      with, who consented unto him, and left it to him to execute, and to
      receive y<sup>e</sup> money at London and send it downe to them at Hamton,
      wher they made y<sup>e</sup> provissions; the which he accordingly did,
      though it was against his minde, &amp; some of y<sup>e</sup> marchants, y<sup>t</sup>
      they were their made. And for giveing them notise at Leyden of this
      change, he could not well in regarde of y<sup>e</sup> shortnes of y<sup>e</sup>
      time; againe, he knew it would trouble them and hinder y<sup>e</sup>
      bussines, which was already delayed overlong in regard of y<sup>e</sup>
      season of y<sup>e</sup> year, which he feared they would find to their
      cost. But these things gave not contente at presente. Mr. Weston, likwise,
      came up from London to see them dispatcht and to have y<sup>e</sup>
      conditions confirmed; but they refused, and answered him, that he knew
      right well that these were not according to y<sup>e</sup> first
      agreemente, neither could they yeeld to them without y<sup>e</sup>
      consente of the rest that were behind. And indeed they had spetiall charge
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>when
      they came away, from the cheefe of those that were behind, not to doe it.
      At which he was much offended, and tould them, they must then looke to
      stand on their owne leggs. So he returned in displeasure, and this was y<sup>e</sup>
      first ground of discontent betweene them. And wheras ther wanted well near
      100<sup>li</sup>. to clear things at their going away, he would not take
      order to disburse a penie, but let them shift as they could. [38] So they
      were forst to selle of some of their provissions to stop this gape, which
      was some 3. or 4. score firkins of butter, which comoditie they might best
      spare, haveing provided too large a quantitie of y<sup>t</sup> kind. Then
      they write a leter to y<sup>e</sup> marchants &amp; adventures aboute y<sup>e</sup>
      diferances concerning y<sup>e</sup> conditions, as foloweth.

        Beloved freinds, sory we are that ther should be occasion of writing at
        all unto you, partly because we ever expected to see y<sup>e</sup> most
        of you hear, but espetially because ther should any differance at all be
        conceived betweene us. But seing it faleth out that we cannot conferr
        togeather, we thinke it meete (though brefly) to show you y<sup>e</sup>
        just cause &amp; reason of our differing from those articles last made
        by Robart Cushman, without our comission or knowledg. And though he
        might propound good ends to himselfe, yet it no way justifies his doing
        it. Our maine diference is in y<sup>e</sup> 5. &amp; 9. article,
        concerning y<sup>e</sup> deviding or holding of house and lands; the
        injoying wherof some of your selves well know, was one spetiall motive,
        amongst many other, to provoke us to goe. This was thought so
        reasonable, y<sup>t</sup> when y<sup>e</sup> greatest of you in <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>adventure
        (whom we have much cause to respecte), when he propounded conditions to
        us freely of his owne accorde, he set this downe for one; a coppy wherof
        we have sent unto you, with some additions then added by us; which being
        liked on both sids, and a day set for y<sup>e</sup> paimente of moneys,
        those of Holland paid in theirs. After y<sup>t</sup>, Robart Cushman, M<sup>r</sup>.
        Peirce, &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Martine, brought them into a better forme,
        &amp; write them in a booke now extante; and upon Robarts shewing them
        and delivering M<sup>r</sup>. Mullins a coppy therof under his hand
        (which we have), he payd in his money. And we of Holland had never seen
        other before our coming to Hamton, but only as one got for him selfe a
        private coppy of them; upon sight wherof we manyfested uter dislike, but
        had put of our estats &amp; were ready to come, and therfore was too
        late to rejecte y<sup>e</sup> vioage. Judge therfore we beseech you
        indiferently of things, and if a faulte have bene com&#773;ited, lay it
        wher it is, &amp; not upon us, who have more cause to stand for y<sup>e</sup>
        one, then you have for y<sup>e</sup> other. We never gave Robart Cushman
        comission to make any one article for us, but only sent him to receive
        moneys upon articles before agreed on, and to further y<sup>e</sup>
        provissions till John Carver came, and to assiste him in it. Yet since
        you conceive your selves wronged as well as we, we thought meete to add
        a branch to y<sup>e</sup> end of our 9. article, as will allmost heale
        that wound of it selfe, which you conceive to be in it. But that it may
        appeare to all men y<sup>t</sup> we are not lovers of our selves only,
        but desire also y<sup>e</sup> good &amp; inriching of our freinds who
        have adventured your moneys with our persons, we have added our last
        article to y<sup>e</sup> rest, promising you againe by leters in y<sup>e</sup>
        behalfe of the whole company, that if large profits should not arise
        within y<sup>e</sup> 7. years, y<sup>t</sup> we will continue togeather
        longer with you, if y<sup>e</sup> Lord give a blessing.<a
        name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24"
        class="fnanchor">[X]</a> This we hope is sufficente to satisfie any in
        this case, espetialy freinds, since we are asured y<sup>t</sup> if <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>the whole
        charge was devided into 4. parts, 3. of them will not stand upon it,
        nether doe regarde it, &amp;c. We are in shuch a streate at presente, as
        we are forced to sell away 60<sup>li</sup>. worth of our provissions to
        cleare y<sup>e</sup> Haven, &amp; withall put our selves upon great
        extremities, scarce haveing any butter, no oyle, not a sole to mend a
        shoe, [39] nor every man a sword to his side, wanting many muskets, much
        armoure, &amp;c. And yet we are willing to expose our selves to shuch
        eminente dangers as are like to insue, &amp; trust to y<sup>e</sup> good
        providence of God, rather then his name &amp; truth should be evill
        spoken of for us. Thus saluting all of you in love, and beseeching the
        Lord to give a blesing to our endeavore, and keepe all our harts in y<sup>e</sup>

        class="fnanchor">[Y]</a>Lovinge Christian friends, I doe hartily &amp;
        in y<sup>e</sup> Lord salute you all, as being they with whom I am
        presente in my best affection, and most ernest longings after you,
        though I be constrained for a while to be bodily absente from you. I say
        constrained, God knowing how willingly, &amp; much rather then
        otherwise, I would have borne my part with you in this first brunt, were
        I not by strong necessitie held back for y<sup>e</sup> present. Make
        accounte of me in y<sup>e</sup> mean while, as of a man devided in my
        selfe with great paine, and as (naturall bonds set a side) having my
        beter parte with [40] you. And though I doubt not but in your godly
        wisdoms, you both foresee &amp; resolve upon y<sup>t</sup> which
        concerneth your presente state &amp; condition, both severally &amp;
        joyntly, yet have I thought it but my duty to add some furder spurr of
        provocation unto them, who rune allready, if not because you need it,
        yet because I owe it in love &amp; dutie. And first, as we are daly to
        renew our repentance with our God, espetially for our sines known, and
        generally for our unknowne trespasses, so doth y<sup>e</sup> Lord call
        us in a singuler maner upon occasions of shuch difficultie &amp; danger
        as lieth upon you, to a both more narrow search &amp; carefull
        reformation of your ways in his sight; least he, calling to remembrance
        our sines forgotten by us or unrepented of, take advantage against us,
        &amp; in judgmente leave us for y<sup>e</sup> same to be swalowed up in
        one danger or other; wheras, on the contrary, sine being taken away by
        ernest repentance &amp; y<sup>e</sup> pardon therof from y<sup>e</sup>
        Lord sealed up unto a mans conscience by his spirite, great shall be his
        securitie and peace in all dangers, sweete his comforts in all
        distresses, with hapie deliverance from all evill, whether in life or in
        death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now next after this heavenly peace with God &amp; our owne consciences,
        we are carefully to provide for peace with all men what in us lieth,
        espetially with our associats, &amp; for y<sup>e</sup> watchfullnes must
        be had, that we neither at all in our selves doe give, no nor easily
        take offence being given by others. Woe be unto y<sup>e</sup> world for
        offences, for though it be necessarie (considering <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup> malice of Satan
        &amp; mans corruption) that offences come, yet woe unto y<sup>e</sup>
        man or woman either by whom y<sup>e</sup> offence cometh, saith Christ,
        Mat. 18. 7. And if offences in y<sup>e</sup> unseasonable use of things
        in them selves indifferent, be more to be feared then death itselfe, as
        y<sup>e</sup> Apostle teacheth, 1. Cor. 9. 15. how much more in things
        simply evill, in which neither honour of God nor love of man is thought
        worthy to be regarded. Neither yet is it sufficiente y<sup>t</sup> we
        keepe our selves by y<sup>e</sup> grace of God from giveing offence,
        exepte withall we be armed against y<sup>e</sup> taking of them when
        they be given by others. For how imperfect &amp; lame is y<sup>e</sup>
        work of grace in y<sup>t</sup> person, who wants charritie to cover a
        multitude of offences, as y<sup>e</sup> scriptures speake. Neither are
        you to be exhorted to this grace only upon y<sup>e</sup> com&#773;one
        grounds of Christianitie, which are, that persons ready to take offence,
        either wante charitie, to cover offences, of wisdome duly to waigh
        humane frailtie; or lastly, are grosse, though close hipocrites, as
        Christ our Lord teacheth, Mat. 7. 1, 2, 3, as indeed in my owne
        experience, few or none have bene found which sooner give offence, then
        shuch as easily take it; neither have they ever proved sound &amp;
        profitable members in societies, which have nurished this touchey humor.
        But besids these, ther are diverse motives provoking you above others to
        great care &amp; conscience this way: As first, you are many of you
        strangers, as to y<sup>e</sup> persons, so to y<sup>e</sup> infirmities
        one of another, &amp; so stand in neede of more watchfullnes this way,
        least when shuch things fall out in men &amp; women as you suspected
        not, you be inordinatly affected with them; which doth require at your
        hands much wisdome &amp; charitie for y<sup>e</sup> covering &amp;
        preventing of incident offences that way. And lastly, your intended
        course of civill comunitie will minister continuall occasion of offence,
        &amp; will be as fuell for that fire, excepte you dilligently quench it
        with brotherly forbearance. And if taking of offence causlesly or
        easilie at mens doings be so carefuly to be avoyded, how much <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>more heed
        is to be taken y<sup>t</sup> we take not offence at God him selfe, which
        yet we certainly doe so oft&#275; as we doe murmure at his providence in
        our crosses, or beare impatiently shuch afflictions as wherwith he
        pleaseth to visite us. Store up therfore patience against y<sup>e</sup>
        evill day, without which we take offence at y<sup>e</sup> Lord him selfe
        in his holy &amp; just works.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 4. thing ther is carfully to be provided for, to witte, that with your
        com&#773;one imployments you joyne com&#773;one affections truly bente
        upon y<sup>e</sup> generall good, avoyding as a deadly [41] plague of
        your both com&#773;one &amp; spetiall comfort all retirednes of minde
        for proper advantage, and all singularly affected any maner of way; let
        every man represe in him selfe &amp; y<sup>e</sup> whol body in each
        person, as so many rebels against y<sup>e</sup> commone good, all
        private respects of mens selves, not sorting with y<sup>e</sup> generall
        conveniencie. And as men are carfull not to have a new house shaken with
        any violence before it be well setled &amp; y<sup>e</sup> parts firmly
        knite, so be you, I beseech you, brethren, much more carfull, y<sup>t</sup>
        the house of God which you are, and are to be, be not shaken with
        unnecessarie novelties or other oppositions at y<sup>e</sup> first
        setling therof.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, wheras you are become a body politik, using amongst your selves
        civill govermente, and are not furnished with any persons of spetiall
        eminencie above y<sup>e</sup> rest, to be chosen by you into office of
        goverment, let your wisdome &amp; godlines appeare, not only in chusing
        shuch persons as doe entirely love and will promote y<sup>e</sup> com&#773;one
        good, but also in yeelding unto them all due honour &amp; obedience in
        their lawfull administrations; not behoulding in them y<sup>e</sup>
        ordinarinesse of their persons, but Gods ordinance for your good, not
        being like y<sup>e</sup> foolish multitud who more honour y<sup>e</sup>
        gay coate, then either y<sup>e</sup> vertuous minde of y<sup>e</sup>
        man, or glorious ordinance of y<sup>e</sup> Lord. But you know better
        things, &amp; that y<sup>e</sup> image of y<sup>e</sup> Lords power
        &amp; authoritie which y<sup>e</sup> magistrate beareth, is honourable,
        in how meane persons <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>soever.
        And this dutie you both may y<sup>e</sup> more willingly and ought y<sup>e</sup>
        more conscionably to performe, because you are at least for y<sup>e</sup>
        present to have only them for your ordinarie governours, which your
        selves shall make choyse of for that worke.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sundrie other things of importance I could put you in minde of, and of
        those before mentioned, in more words, but I will not so farr wrong your
        godly minds as to thinke you heedless of these things, ther being also
        diverce among you so well able to admonish both them selves &amp; others
        of what concerneth them. These few things therfore, &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
        same in few words, I doe ernestly com&#773;end unto your care &amp;
        conscience, joyning therwith my daily incessante prayers unto y<sup>e</sup>
        Lord, y<sup>t</sup> he who hath made y<sup>e</sup> heavens &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
        earth, y<sup>e</sup> sea and all rivers of waters, and whose providence
        is over all his workes, espetially over all his dear children for good,
        would so guide &amp; gard you in your wayes, as inwardly by his Spirite,
        so outwardly by y<sup>e</sup> hand of his power, as y<sup>t</sup> both
        you &amp; we also, for &amp; with you, may have after matter of praising
        his name all y<sup>e</sup> days of your and our lives. Fare you well in
        him in whom you trust, and in whom I rest.

      This letter, though large, yet being so frutfull in it selfe, and suitable
      to their occation, I thought meete to inserte in this place.
    </p>
    <p>
      All things being now ready, &amp; every bussines dispatched, the company
      was caled togeather, and this letter read amongst them, which had good
      acceptation with all, and after fruit with many. Then they ordered <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>&amp;
      distributed their company for either shipe, as they conceived for y<sup>e</sup>
      best. And chose a Governor &amp; 2. or 3. assistants for each shipe, to
      order y<sup>e</sup> people by y<sup>e</sup> way, and see to y<sup>e</sup>
      dispossing of there provissions, and shuch like affairs. All which was not
      only with y<sup>e</sup> liking of y<sup>e</sup> maisters of y<sup>e</sup>
      ships, but according to their desires. Which being done, they sett sayle
      from thence aboute y<sup>e</sup> 5. of August; but what befell them
      further upon y<sup>e</sup> coast of England will appeare in y<sup>e</sup>
      nexte chapter.

      <i>Off the troubls that befell them on the coaste, and at sea being
      forced, after much trouble, to leave one of ther ships &amp; some of their
      companie behind them.</i>

    <p>
      [42] Being thus put to sea they had not gone farr, but M<sup>r</sup>.
      Reinolds y<sup>e</sup> master of y<sup>e</sup> leser ship complained that
      he found his ship so leak as he durst not put further to sea till she was
      mended. So y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>. of y<sup>e</sup> biger ship (caled
      M<sup>r</sup>. Jonas) being consulted with, they both resolved to put into
      Dartmouth &amp; have her ther searched &amp; mended, which accordingly was
      done, to their great charg &amp; losse of time and a faire winde. She was
      hear thorowly searcht from steme to sterne, some leaks were found &amp;
      mended, and now it was conceived by the workmen &amp; all, that she was
      sufficiente, &amp; they might proceede without either fear or danger. So
      with good hopes from hence, they put <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>to sea againe, conceiving they
      should goe comfortably on, not looking for any more lets of this kind; but
      it fell out otherwise, for after they were gone to sea againe above 100.
      leagues without the Lands End, houlding company togeather all this while,
      the m<sup>r</sup>. of y<sup>e</sup> small ship complained his ship was so
      leake as he must beare up or sinke at sea, for they could scarce free her
      with much pumping. So they came to consultation againe, and resolved both
      ships to bear up backe againe &amp; put into Plim&#773;oth, which
      accordingly was done. But no spetiall leake could be founde, but it was
      judged to be y<sup>e</sup> generall weaknes of y<sup>e</sup> shipe, and
      that shee would not prove sufficiente for the voiage. Upon which it was
      resolved to dismise her &amp; parte of y<sup>e</sup> companie, and
      proceede with y<sup>e</sup> other shipe. The which (though it was
      greevous, &amp; caused great discouragmente) was put in execution. So
      after they had tooke out such provission as y<sup>e</sup> other ship could
      well stow, and concluded both what number and what persons to send bak,
      they made another sad parting, y<sup>e</sup> one ship going backe for
      London, and y<sup>e</sup> other was to proceede on her viage. Those that
      went bak were for the most parte such as were willing so to doe, either
      out of some discontente, or feare they conceived of y<sup>e</sup> ill
      success of y<sup>e</sup> vioage, seeing so many croses befale, &amp; the
      year time so farr spente; but others, in regarde of their owne weaknes,
      and charge of many yonge children, were thought least usefull, and most
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>unfite
      to bear y<sup>e</sup> brunte of this hard adventure; unto which worke of
      God, and judgmente of their brethern, they were contented to submite. And
      thus, like Gedions armie, this small number was devided, as if y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord by this worke of his providence thought these few to many for y<sup>e</sup>
      great worke he had to doe. But here by the way let me show, how afterward
      it was found y<sup>t</sup> the leaknes of this ship was partly by being
      over masted, and too much pressed with sayles; for after she was sould
      &amp; put into her old trime, she made many viages &amp; performed her
      service very sufficiently, to y<sup>e</sup> great profite of her owners.
      But more espetially, by the cuning &amp; deceite of y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>.
      &amp; his company, who were hired to stay a whole year in y<sup>e</sup>
      cuntrie, and now fancying dislike &amp; fearing wante of victeles, they
      ploted this strategem to free them selves; as afterwards was knowne, &amp;
      by some of them confessed. For they apprehended y<sup>t</sup> the greater
      ship, being of force, &amp; in whom most of y<sup>e</sup> provissions were
      stowed, she would retayne enough for her selfe, what soever became of them
      or y<sup>e</sup> passengers; &amp; indeed shuch speeches had bene cast out
      by some of them; and yet, besids other incouragments, y<sup>e</sup> cheefe
      of them that came from Leyden wente in this shipe to give y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>.
      contente. But so strong was self love &amp; his fears, as he forgott all
      duty and [43] former kindnesses, &amp; delt thus falsly with them, though
      he pretended otherwise. Amongest those that returned was M<sup>r</sup>.
      Cushman &amp; his familie, whose hart <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>&amp; courage was gone from
      them before, as it seems, though his body was with them till now he
      departed; as may appear by a passionate letter he write to a freind in
      London from Dartmouth, whilst y<sup>e</sup> ship lay ther a mending; the
      which, besids y<sup>e</sup> expressions of his owne fears, it shows much
      of y<sup>e</sup> providence of God working for their good beyonde man's
      expectation, &amp; other things concerning their condition in these
      streats. I will hear relate it. And though it discover some infirmities in
      him (as who under temtation is free), yet after this he continued to be a
      spetiall instrumente for their good, and to doe y<sup>e</sup> offices of a
      loving freind &amp; faithfull brother unto them, and pertaker of much
      comforte with them.

      <p>
        Loving friend, my most kind remembrance to you &amp; your wife, with
        loving E. M. &amp;c. whom in this world I never looke to see againe. For
        besids y<sup>e</sup> eminente dangers of this viage, which are no less
        then deadly, an infirmitie of body hath ceased me, which will not in all
        lie<sup>c</sup>lyhoode leave me till death. What to call it I know not,
        but it is a bundle of lead, as it were, crushing my harte more &amp;
        more these 14. days, as that allthough I doe y<sup>e</sup> acctions of a
        liveing man, yet I am but as dead; but y<sup>e</sup> will of God be
        done. Our pinass will not cease leaking, els I thinke we had been halfe
        way at Virginia, our viage hither hath been as full of crosses, as our
        selves <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>have
        been of crokednes. We put in hear to trim&#773;e her, &amp; I thinke, as
        others also, if we had stayed at sea but 3. or 4. howers more, shee
        would have sunke right downe. And though she was twise trim&#773;ed at
        Hamton, yet now shee is open and leakie as a seive; and ther was a
        borde, a man might have puld of with his fingers, 2 foote longe, wher y<sup>e</sup>
        water came in as at a mole hole. We lay at Hamton 7. days, in fair
        weather, waiting for her, and now we lye hear waiting for her in as
        faire a wind as can blowe, and so have done these 4. days, and are like
        to lye 4. more, and by y<sup>t</sup> time y<sup>e</sup> wind will
        happily turne as it did at Hampton. Our victualls will be halfe eaten
        up, I thinke, before we goe from the coaste of England, and if our viage
        last longe, we shall not have a months victialls when we come in y<sup>e</sup>
        countrie. Neare 700<sup>li</sup>. hath bene bestowed at Hampton, upon
        what I know not. Mr. Martin saith he neither can nor will give any
        accounte of it, and if he be called upon for accounts he crieth out of
        unthankfullnes for his paines &amp; care, that we are susspitious of
        him, and flings away, &amp; will end nothing. Also he so insult&#275;h
        over our poore people, with shuch scorne &amp; contempte, as if they
        were not good enough to wipe his shoes. It would break your hart to see
        his dealing,<a name="FNanchor_AA_27" id="FNanchor_AA_27"></a><a
        href="#Footnote_AA_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a> and y<sup>e</sup>
        mourning of our people. They complaine to me, &amp; alass! I can doe
        nothing for them; if I speake to him, he flies in my face, as mutinous,
        and saith no complaints shall be heard or received but by him selfe, and
        saith they are forwarde, &amp; waspish, discontented people, &amp; I doe
        ill to hear them. Ther are others y<sup>t</sup> would lose all they have
        put in, or make satisfaction for what they have had, that they might
        departe: but he will not hear them, nor suffer them to goe ashore, least
        they should rune away. The sailors also are so offended at his ignorante
        bouldnes, in medling &amp; controuling in things he knows not what
        belongs too, as y<sup>t</sup> some <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>threaten to misscheefe him,
        others say they will leave y<sup>e</sup> shipe &amp; goe their way. But
        at y<sup>e</sup> best this cometh of it, y<sup>t</sup> he maks him selfe
        a scorne &amp; laughing stock unto them. As for M<sup>r</sup>. Weston,
        excepte grace doe greatly swaye with him, he will hate us ten times more
        then ever he loved us, for not confirming y<sup>e</sup> conditions. But
        now, since some pinches have taken them, they begine to reveile y<sup>e</sup>
        trueth, &amp; say M<sup>r</sup>. Robinson was in y<sup>e</sup> falte who
        charged them never to consente to those conditions, nor chuse me into
        office, but indeede apointed them to chose them they did chose.<a
        name="FNanchor_AB_28" id="FNanchor_AB_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_28"
        class="fnanchor">[AB]</a> But he &amp; they will rue too late, they may
        [44] now see, &amp; all be ashamed when it is too late, that they were
        so ignorante, yea, &amp; so inordinate in their courses. I am sure as
        they were resolved not to seale those conditions, I was not so resolute
        at Hampton to have left y<sup>e</sup> whole bussines, excepte they would
        seale them, &amp; better y<sup>e</sup> vioage to have bene broken of

        never received no money on those conditions, he was not beholden to y<sup>e</sup>

        Simple man, he indeed never made any conditions w<sup>th</sup> the
        marchants, nor ever spake with them. But did all that money flie to
        Hampton, or was it his owne? Who will goe &amp; lay out money so rashly

        God works a mirakle; especially considering how scante we shall be of
        victualls, and most of all ununited amongst our selves, &amp; devoyd of
        good tutors &amp; regimente. Violence will break all. Wher is y<sup>e</sup>

        wealths, when y<sup>e</sup> morter is yet scarce tempered y<sup>t</sup>
        should bind y<sup>e</sup> wales. If I should write to you of all things

        evill tidings of us every day. But pray for us instantly, it may be y<sup>e</sup>
        Lord will be yet entreated one way or other to make for us. I see not in
        reason how we shall escape even y<sup>e</sup> gasping of hunger starved
        persons; but God can doe much, &amp; his will be done. It is better for
        me to dye, then now for me to bear it, which I doe daly, &amp; expecte
        it howerly; haveing received y<sup>e</sup> sentance of death, both

        after y<sup>e</sup> flesh no more, but looking unto y<sup>e</sup> joye y<sup>t</sup>
        is before us, we will endure all these things and accounte them light in
        comparison of y<sup>t</sup> joye we hope for. Remember me in all love to
        our freinds as if I named them, whose praiers I desire ernestly, &amp;
        wish againe to see, but not till I can with more comforte looke them in
        y<sup>e</sup> face. The Lord give us that true comforte which none can
        take from us. I had a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90"

        estate to some freind. I doubte not but your wisdome will teach you
        seasonably to utter things as here after you shall be called to it. That
        which I have writen is treue, &amp; many things more which I have
        forborne. I write it as upon my life, and last confession in England.
        What is of use to be spoken [45] of presently, you may speake of it, and

      which continued diverce days togeather, which was some incouragmente unto
      them; yet according to y<sup>e</sup> usuall maner many were afflicted with
      sea-sicknes. And I may not omite hear a spetiall worke of Gods providence.
      Ther was a proud &amp; very profane yonge man, one of y<sup>e</sup> <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>sea-men, of
      a lustie, able body, which made him the more hauty; he would allway be
      contemning y<sup>e</sup> poore people in their sicknes, &amp; cursing them
      dayly with gre&#275;ous execrations, and did not let to tell them, that he
      hoped to help to cast halfe of them over board before they came to their
      jurneys end, and to make mery with what they had; and if he were by any
      gently reproved, he would curse and swear most bitterly. But it plased God
      before they came halfe seas over, to smite this yong man with a greeveous
      disease, of which he dyed in a desperate maner, and so was him selfe y<sup>e</sup>
      first y<sup>t</sup> was throwne overbord. Thus his curses light on his
      owne head; and it was an astonishmente to all his fellows, for they noted
      it to be y<sup>e</sup> just hand of God upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they had injoyed faire winds and weather for a season, they were
      incountred many times with crosse winds, and mette with many feirce
      stormes, with which y<sup>e</sup> shipe was shroudly shaken, and her upper
      works made very leakie; and one of the maine beames in y<sup>e</sup> midd
      ships was bowed &amp; craked, which put them in some fear that y<sup>e</sup>
      shipe could not be able to performe y<sup>e</sup> vioage. So some of y<sup>e</sup>
      cheefe of y<sup>e</sup> company, perceiveing y<sup>e</sup> mariners to
      feare y<sup>e</sup> suffisiencie of y<sup>e</sup> shipe, as appeared by
      their mutterings, they entred into serious consulltation with y<sup>e</sup>
      m<sup>r</sup>. &amp; other officers of y<sup>e</sup> ship, to consider in
      time of y<sup>e</sup> danger; and rather to returne then to cast them
      selves into a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>desperate
      &amp; inevitable perill. And truly ther was great distraction &amp;
      differance of opinion amongst y<sup>e</sup> mariners them selves; faine
      would they doe what could be done for their wages sake, (being now halfe
      the seas over,) and on y<sup>e</sup> other hand they were loath to hazard
      their lives too desperatly. But in examening of all opinions, the m<sup>r</sup>.
      &amp; others affirmed they knew y<sup>e</sup> ship to be stronge &amp;
      firme under water; and for the buckling of y<sup>e</sup> maine beame, ther
      was a great iron scrue y<sup>e</sup> passengers brought out of Holland,
      which would raise y<sup>e</sup> beame into his place; y<sup>e</sup> which
      being done, the carpenter &amp; m<sup>r</sup>. affirmed that with a post
      put under it, set firme in y<sup>e</sup> lower deck, &amp; otherways
      bounde, he would make it sufficiente. And as for y<sup>e</sup> decks &amp;
      uper workes they would calke them as well as they could, and though with y<sup>e</sup>
      workeing of y<sup>e</sup> ship they [46] would not longe keepe stanch, yet
      ther would otherwise be no great danger, if they did not overpress her
      with sails. So they com&#773;ited them selves to y<sup>e</sup> will of
      God, &amp; resolved to proseede. In sundrie of these stormes the winds
      were so feirce, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> seas so high, as they could not beare
      a knote of saile, but were forced to hull, for diverce days togither. And
      in one of them, as they thus lay at hull, in a mighty storme, a lustie
      yonge man (called John Howland) coming upon some occasion above y<sup>e</sup>
      grattings, was, with a seele of the shipe throwne into [y<sup>e</sup>]
      sea; but it pleased God y<sup>t</sup> he caught hould of y<sup>e</sup>
      top-saile <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>halliards,
      which hunge over board, &amp; rane out at length; yet he held his hould
      (though he was sundrie fadomes under water) till he was hald up by y<sup>e</sup>
      same rope to y<sup>e</sup> brime of y<sup>e</sup> water, and then with a
      boat hooke &amp; other means got into y<sup>e</sup> shipe againe, &amp;
      his life saved; and though he was something ill with it, yet he lived many
      years after, and became a profitable member both in church &amp; com&#773;one
      wealthe. In all this viage ther died but one of y<sup>e</sup> passengers,
      which was William Butten, a youth, servant to Samuell Fuller, when they
      drew near y<sup>e</sup> coast. But to omite other things, (that I may be
      breefe,) after longe beating at sea they fell with that land which is
      called Cape Cod; the which being made &amp; certainly knowne to be it,
      they were not a litle joyfull. After some deliberation had amongst them
      selves &amp; with y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>. of y<sup>e</sup> ship, they
      tacked aboute and resolved to stande for y<sup>e</sup> southward (y<sup>e</sup>
      wind &amp; weather being faire) to finde some place aboute Hudsons river
      for their habitation. But after they had sailed y<sup>t</sup> course
      aboute halfe y<sup>e</sup> day, they fell amongst deangerous shoulds and
      roring breakers, and they were so farr intangled ther with as they
      conceived them selves in great danger; &amp; y<sup>e</sup> wind shrinking
      upon them withall, they resolved to bear up againe for the Cape, and
      thought them selves hapy to gett out of those dangers before night
      overtooke them, as by Gods providence they did. And y<sup>e</sup> next day
      they gott into y<sup>e</sup> Cape-harbor wher they ridd in <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>saftie. A
      word or too by y<sup>e</sup> way of this cape; it was thus first named by
      Capten Gosnole &amp; his company,<a name="FNanchor_AF_32"
      id="FNanchor_AF_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_AF_32" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a>
      Anno: 1602, and after by Capten Smith was caled Cape James; but it retains
      y<sup>e</sup> former name amongst seamen. Also y<sup>t</sup> pointe which
      first shewed those dangerous shoulds unto them, they called Pointe Care,
      &amp; Tuckers Terrour; but y<sup>e</sup> French &amp; Dutch to this day
      call it Malabarr, by reason of those perilous shoulds, and y<sup>e</sup>
      losses they have suffered their.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being thus arived in a good harbor and brought safe to land, they fell
      upon their knees &amp; blessed y<sup>e</sup> God of heaven, who had
      brought them over y<sup>e</sup> vast &amp; furious ocean, and delivered
      them from all y<sup>e</sup> periles &amp; miseries therof, againe to set
      their feete on y<sup>e</sup> firme and stable earth, their proper
      elemente. And no marvell if they were thus joyefull, seeing wise Seneca
      was so affected with sailing a few miles on y<sup>e</sup> coast of his
      owne Italy; as he affirmed,<a name="FNanchor_AG_33" id="FNanchor_AG_33"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_AG_33" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a> that he had rather
      remaine twentie years on his way by land, then pass by sea to any place in
      a short time; so tedious &amp; dreadfull was y<sup>e</sup> same unto him.

    <p>
      But hear I cannot but stay and make a pause, and stand half amased at this
      poore peoples presente condition; and so I thinke will the reader too,
      when he well considers [47] y<sup>e</sup> same. Being thus passed y<sup>e</sup>
      vast ocean, and a sea of troubles before in their preparation (as may be
      remembred by y<sup>t</sup> which wente <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>before), they had now no
      freinds to wellcome them, nor inns to entertaine or refresh their
      weatherbeaten bodys, no houses or much less townes to repaire too, to
      seeke for succoure. It is recorded in scripture<a name="FNanchor_AH_34"
      id="FNanchor_AH_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_AH_34" class="fnanchor">[AH]</a>
      as a mercie to y<sup>e</sup> apostle &amp; his shipwraked company, y<sup>t</sup>
      the barbarians shewed them no smale kindnes in refreshing them, but these
      savage barbarians, when they mette with them (as after will appeare) were
      readier to fill their sids full of arrows then otherwise. And for y<sup>e</sup>
      season it was winter, and they that know y<sup>e</sup> winters of y<sup>t</sup>
      cuntrie know them to be sharp &amp; violent, &amp; subjecte to cruell
      &amp; feirce stormes, deangerous to travill to known places, much more to
      serch an unknown coast. Besids, what could they see but a hidious &amp;
      desolate wildernes, full of wild beasts &amp; willd men? and what
      multituds ther might be of them they knew not. Nether could they, as it
      were, goe up to y<sup>e</sup> tope of Pisgah, to vew from this willdernes
      a more goodly cuntrie to feed their hops; for which way soever they turnd
      their eys (save upward to y<sup>e</sup> heavens) they could have litle
      solace or content in respecte of any outward objects. For sum&#773;er
      being done, all things stand upon them with a wetherbeaten face; and y<sup>e</sup>
      whole countrie, full of woods &amp; thickets, represented a wild &amp;
      savage heiw. If they looked behind them, ther was y<sup>e</sup> mighty
      ocean which they had passed, and was now as a <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>maine barr &amp; goulfe to
      seperate them from all y<sup>e</sup> civill parts of y<sup>e</sup> world.
      If it be said they had a ship to sucour them, it is trew; but what heard
      they daly from y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>. &amp; company? but y<sup>t</sup>
      with speede they should looke out a place with their shallop, wher they
      would be at some near distance; for y<sup>e</sup> season was shuch as he
      would not stirr from thence till a safe harbor was discovered by them wher
      they would be, and he might goe without danger; and that victells consumed
      apace, but he must &amp; would keepe sufficient for them selves &amp;
      their returne. Yea, it was muttered by some, that if they gott not a place
      in time, they would turne them &amp; their goods ashore &amp; leave them.
      Let it also be considred what weake hopes of supply &amp; succoure they
      left behinde them, y<sup>t</sup> might bear up their minds in this sade
      condition and trialls they were under; and they could not but be very
      smale. It is true, indeed, y<sup>e</sup> affections &amp; love of their
      brethren at Leyden was cordiall &amp; entire towards them, but they had
      litle power to help them, or them selves; and how y<sup>e</sup> case stode
      betweene them &amp; y<sup>e</sup> marchants at their coming away, hath
      allready been declared. What could now sustaine them but the spirite of
      God &amp; his grace? May not &amp; ought not the children of these fathers
      rightly say: <i>Our faithers were Englishmen which came over this great

      [48] Being thus arrived at Cap-Cod y<sup>e</sup> 11. of November, and

      rather because as they wente into y<sup>t</sup> harbor ther seemed to be
      an opening some 2. or 3 leagues of, which y<sup>e</sup> maister judged to
      be a river. It was conceived ther might be some danger in y<sup>e</sup>
      attempte, yet seeing them resolute, they were permited to goe, being 16.
      of them well armed, under y<sup>e</sup> conduct of Captain Standish,
      having shuch instructions given them as was thought meete. They sett forth
      y<sup>e</sup> 15. of Nove<sup>br</sup>: and when they had marched aboute

      English followed them, partly to see if they could speake with them, and
      partly to discover if ther might not be more of them lying in ambush. But
      y<sup>e</sup> Indeans seeing them selves thus followed, they againe
      forsooke the woods, &amp; rane away on y<sup>e</sup> sands as hard as they
      could, so as they could not come near them, but followed them by y<sup>e</sup>
      tracte of their feet sundrie miles, and saw that they had come the same
      way. So, night coming on, they made their randevous &amp; set out their
      sentinels, and rested in quiete <i>y<sup>t</sup> night</i>, and the next
      morning followed their tracte till they had headed a great creake, &amp;
      so left the sands, &amp; turned an other way into y<sup>e</sup> woods. But
      they still followed them by geuss, hopeing to find their dwellings; but
      they soone lost both them &amp; them selves, falling into shuch thickets
      as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>were
      ready to tear their cloaths &amp; armore in peeces, but were most
      distresed for wante of drinke. But at length they found water &amp;
      refreshed them selves, being y<sup>e</sup> first New-England water they
      drunke of, and was now in thir great thirste as pleasante unto them as
      wine or bear had been in for-times. Afterwards they directed their course
      to come to y<sup>e</sup> other [49] shore, for they knew it was a necke of
      land they were to crosse over, and so at length gott to y<sup>e</sup>
      sea-side, and marched to this supposed river, &amp; by y<sup>e</sup> way
      found a pond of clear fresh water, and shortly after a good quantitie of
      clear ground wher y<sup>e</sup> Indeans had formerly set corne, and some
      of their graves. And proceeding furder they saw new-stuble wher corne had
      been set y<sup>e</sup> same year, also they found wher latly a house had
      been, wher some planks and a great ketle was remaining, and heaps of sand
      newly padled with their hands, which they, digging up, found in them
      diverce faire Indean baskets filled with corne, and some in eares, faire
      and good, of diverce collours, which seemed to them a very goodly sight,
      (haveing never seen any shuch before). This was near y<sup>e</sup> place

      leaving it further to be discovered <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>by their shalop when she was
      ready. So their time limeted them being expired, they returned to y<sup>e</sup>
      ship, least they should be in fear of their saftie; and tooke with them
      parte of y<sup>e</sup> corne, and buried up y<sup>e</sup> rest, and so
      like y<sup>e</sup> men from Eshcoll carried with them of y<sup>e</sup>
      fruits of y<sup>e</sup> land, &amp; showed their breethren; of which,
      &amp; their returne, they were marvelusly glad, and their harts
      incouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, y<sup>e</sup> shalop being got ready, they set out againe for
      y<sup>e</sup> better discovery of this place, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>.
      of y<sup>e</sup> ship desired to goe him selfe, so ther went some 30. men,
      but found it to be no harbor for ships but only for boats; ther was allso
      found 2. of their houses covered with matts, &amp; sundrie of their
      implements in them, but y<sup>e</sup> people were rune away &amp; could
      not be seen; also ther was found more of their corne, &amp; of their beans
      of various collours. The corne &amp; beans they brought away, purposing to
      give them full satisfaction when they should meete with any of them (as
      about some 6. months afterward they did, to their good contente). And here
      is to be noted a spetiall providence of God, and a great mercie to this
      poore people, that hear they gott seed to plant them corne y<sup>e</sup>
      next year, or els they might have starved, for they had none, nor any
      liklyhood to get any [50] till y<sup>e</sup> season had beene past (as y<sup>e</sup>
      sequell did manyfest). Neither is it lickly they had had this, if y<sup>e</sup>
      first viage had <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>not
      been made, for the ground was now all covered with snow, &amp; hard
      frozen. But the Lord is never wanting unto his in their greatest needs;
      let his holy name have all y<sup>e</sup> praise.

      The month of November being spente in these affairs, &amp; much foule
      weather falling in, the 6. <i>of Desem<sup>r</sup></i>: they sente out
      their shallop againe with 10. of their principall men, &amp; some sea men,
      upon further discovery, intending to circulate that deepe bay of Cap-codd.
      The weather was very could, &amp; it frose so hard as y<sup>e</sup> sprea
      of y<sup>e</sup> sea lighting on their coats, they were as if they had
      been glased; yet <i>that night</i> betimes they gott downe into y<sup>e</sup>
      botome of y<sup>e</sup> bay, and as they drue nere y<sup>e</sup> shore
      they saw some 10. or 12. Indeans very busie aboute some thing. They landed
      aboute a league or 2. from them, and had much a doe to put a shore any
      wher, it lay so full of flats. Being landed, it grew late, and they made
      them selves a barricade with loggs &amp; bowes as well as they could in y<sup>e</sup>
      time, &amp; set out their sentenill &amp; betooke them to rest, and saw y<sup>e</sup>
      smoake of y<sup>e</sup> fire y<sup>e</sup> savages made y<sup>t</sup>
      night. When <i>morning</i> was come they devided their company, some to
      coaste along y<sup>e</sup> shore in y<sup>e</sup> boate, and the rest
      marched throw y<sup>e</sup> woods to see y<sup>e</sup> land, if any fit
      place might be for their dwelling. They came allso to y<sup>e</sup> place
      wher they saw the Indans y<sup>e</sup> night before, &amp; found they had
      been cuting up a great fish like a grampus, being some 2. inches thike of
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>fate
      like a hogg, some peeces wher of they had left by y<sup>e</sup> way; and y<sup>e</sup>
      shallop found 2. more of these fishes dead on y<sup>e</sup> sands, a thing
      usuall after storms in y<sup>t</sup> place, by reason of y<sup>e</sup>
      great flats of sand that lye of. So they ranged up and doune all y<sup>t</sup>
      day, but found no people, nor any place they liked. When y<sup>e</sup>
      sune grue low, they hasted out of y<sup>e</sup> woods to meete with their
      shallop, to whom they made signes to come to them into a <i>creeke</i>
      hardby, the which they did at highwater; of which they were very glad, for
      they had not seen each other all y<sup>t</sup> day, since y<sup>e</sup>
      morning. So they made them a barricado (as usually they did every night)
      with loggs, staks, &amp; thike pine bowes, y<sup>e</sup> height of a man,
      leaving it open to leeward, partly to shelter them from y<sup>e</sup>
      could &amp; wind (making their fire in y<sup>e</sup> midle, &amp; lying
      round aboute it), and partly to defend them from any sudden assaults of y<sup>e</sup>
      savags, if they should surround them. So being very weary, they betooke
      them to rest. But aboute <i>midnight</i>, [51] they heard a hideous &amp;
      great crie, and their sentinell caled, "Arme, arme"; so they bestired them
      &amp; stood to their armes, &amp; shote of a cupple of moskets, and then
      the noys seased. They concluded it was a companie of wolves, or such like
      willd beasts; for one of y<sup>e</sup> sea men tould them he had often
      heard shuch a noyse in New-found land. So they rested till about 5. of y<sup>e</sup>
      clock in the <i>morning</i>; for y<sup>e</sup> tide, &amp; ther purposs to
      goe from thence, made them be stiring betimes. So <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>after praier they prepared
      for breakfast, and it being day dawning, it was thought best to be carring
      things downe to y<sup>e</sup> boate. But some said it was not best to
      carrie y<sup>e</sup> armes downe, others said they would be the readier,
      for they had laped them up in their coats from y<sup>e</sup> dew. But some
      3. or 4. would not cary theirs till they wente them selves, yet as it fell
      out, y<sup>e</sup> water being not high enough, they layed them downe on y<sup>e</sup>
      banke side, &amp; came up to breakfast. But presently, all on y<sup>e</sup>
      sudain, they heard a great &amp; strange crie, which they knew to be the
      same voyces they heard in y<sup>e</sup> night, though they varied their
      notes, &amp; one of their company being abroad came runing in, &amp;
      cried, "Men, Indeans, Indeans"; and w<sup>th</sup>all, their arowes came
      flying amongst them. Their men rane with all speed to recover their armes,
      as by y<sup>e</sup> good providence of God they did. In y<sup>e</sup> mean
      time, of those that were ther ready, tow muskets were discharged at them,
      &amp; 2. more stood ready in y<sup>e</sup> enterance of ther randevoue,
      but were comanded not to shoote till they could take full aime at them;
      &amp; y<sup>e</sup> other 2. charged againe with all speed, for ther were
      only 4. had armes ther, &amp; defended y<sup>e</sup> baricado which was
      first assalted. The crie of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans was dreadfull,
      espetially when they saw ther men rune out of y<sup>e</sup> randevoue
      towourds y<sup>e</sup> shallop, to recover their armes, the Indeans
      wheeling aboute upon them. But some run&#773;ing out with coats of malle
      on, &amp; cutlasses <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>in
      their hands, they soone got their armes, &amp; let flye amongs them, and
      quickly stopped their violence. Yet ther was a lustie man, and no less
      valiante, stood behind a tree within halfe a musket shot, and let his
      arrows flie at them. He was seen shoot 3. arrowes, which were all avoyded.
      He stood 3. shot of a musket, till one taking full aime at him, and made y<sup>e</sup>
      barke or splinters of y<sup>e</sup> tree fly about his ears, after which
      he gave an extraordinary shrike, and away they wente all of them. They
      left some to keep y<sup>e</sup> shalop, and followed them aboute a quarter
      of a mille, and shouted once or twise, and shot of 2. or 3. peces, &amp;
      so returned. This they did, that they might conceive that they were not
      [52] affrade of them or any way discouraged. Thus it pleased God to
      vanquish their enimies, and give them deliverance; and by his spetiall
      providence so to dispose that not any one of them were either hurte, or
      hitt, though their arrows came close by them, &amp; on every side them,
      and sundry of their coats, which hunge up in y<sup>e</sup> barricado, were
      shot throw &amp; throw. Aterwards they gave God sollamne thanks &amp;
      praise for their deliverance, &amp; gathered up a bundle of their arrows,
      &amp; sente them into England afterward by y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>. of
      y<sup>e</sup> ship, and called that place y<sup>e</sup> first encounter.
      From hence they departed, &amp; costed all along, but discerned no place
      likly for harbor; &amp; therfore hasted to a place that their pillote,
      (one Mr. Coppin who had <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105"
      id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>bine in y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie before) did
      assure them was a good harbor, which he had been in, and they might fetch
      it before night; of which they were glad, for it begane to be foule
      weather. After some houres sailing, it begane to snow &amp; raine, &amp;
      about y<sup>e</sup> midle of y<sup>e</sup> afternoone, y<sup>e</sup> wind
      increased, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> sea became very rough, and they broake
      their rudder, &amp; it was as much as 2. men could doe to steere her with
      a cupple of oares. But their pillott bad them be of good cheere, for he
      saw y<sup>e</sup> harbor; but y<sup>e</sup> storme increasing, &amp; night
      drawing on, they bore what saile they could to gett in, while they could
      see. But herwith they broake their mast in 3. peeces, &amp; their saill
      fell over bord, in a very grown sea, so as they had like to have been cast
      away; yet by Gods mercie they recovered them selves, &amp; having y<sup>e</sup>
      floud with them, struck into y<sup>e</sup> harbore. But when it came too,
      y<sup>e</sup> pillott was deceived in y<sup>e</sup> place, and said, y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord be mercifull unto them, for his eys never saw y<sup>t</sup> place
      before; &amp; he &amp; the m<sup>r</sup>. mate would have rune her ashore,
      in a cove full of breakers, before y<sup>e</sup> winde. But a lusty seaman
      which steered, bad those which rowed, if they were men, about with her, or
      ells they were all cast away; the which they did with speed. So he bid
      them be of good cheere &amp; row lustly, for ther was a faire sound before
      them, &amp; he doubted not but they should find one place or other wher
      they might ride in saftie. And though it was <i>very darke</i>, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>and
      rained sore, yet in y<sup>e</sup> end they gott under y<sup>e</sup> lee of
      a smalle iland, and remained ther all y<sup>t</sup> night in saftie. But
      they knew not this to be an iland till morning, but were devided in their
      minds; some would keepe y<sup>e</sup> boate for fear they might be amongst
      y<sup>e</sup> Indians; others were so weake and could, they could not
      endure, but got a shore, &amp; with much adoe got fire, (all things being
      so wett,) and y<sup>e</sup> rest were glad to come to them; for after
      midnight y<sup>e</sup> wind shifted to the [53] north-west, &amp; it frose
      hard. But though this had been a day &amp; night of much trouble &amp;
      danger unto them, yet God gave them a <i>morning</i> of comforte &amp;
      refreshing (as usually he doth to his children), for y<sup>e</sup> next
      day was a faire sunshin&#299;g day, and they found them sellvs to be on an
      iland secure from y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, wher they might drie their stufe,
      fixe their peeces, &amp; rest them selves, and gave God thanks for his
      mercies, in their manifould deliverances. And this being the <i>last day
      of y<sup>e</sup> weeke</i>, they prepared ther to keepe y<sup>e</sup> <i>Sabath</i>.
      On <i>Munday</i> they sounded y<sup>e</sup> harbor, and founde it fitt for
      shipping; and marched into y<sup>e</sup> land, &amp; found diverse
      cornfeilds, &amp; litle runing brooks, a place (as they supposed) fitt for
      situation; at least it was y<sup>e</sup> best they could find, and y<sup>e</sup>
      season, &amp; their presente necessitie, made them glad to accepte of it.
      So they returned to their shipp againe with this news to y<sup>e</sup>
      rest of their people, which did much comforte their harts. <span

      before they came ashore, being y<sup>e</sup> first foundation of their

      fall from them in y<sup>e</sup> ship&mdash;That when they came a shore
      they would use their owne libertie; for none had power to com&#773;and

      After this they chose, or rather confirmed, M<sup>r</sup>. John Carver (a
      man godly &amp; well approved amongst them) their Governour for that year.
      And after they had provided a place for their goods, or comone store,
      (which were long in unlading for want of boats, foulnes of winter weather,
      and sicknes of diverce,) and begune some small cottages for their
      habitation, as time would admitte, they mette and consulted of lawes &amp;
      orders, both for their civill &amp; military Govermente, as y<sup>e</sup>
      necessitie of their condition did require, still adding therunto as urgent
      occasion in severall times, and as cases did require. <span class="pagenum"><a

    <p>
      In these hard &amp; difficulte beginings they found some discontents &amp;
      murmurings arise amongst some, and mutinous speeches &amp; carriags in
      other; but they were soone quelled &amp; overcome by y<sup>e</sup>
      wisdome, patience, and just &amp; equall carrage of things by y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> and better part, w<sup>ch</sup> clave faithfully togeather
      in y<sup>e</sup> maine. But that which was most sadd &amp; lamentable was,
      that in 2. or 3. moneths time halfe of their company dyed, espetialy in
      Jan: &amp; February, being y<sup>e</sup> depth of winter, and wanting
      houses &amp; other comforts; being infected with y<sup>e</sup> scurvie
      &amp; [55] other diseases, which this long vioage &amp; their inacomodate
      condition had brought upon them; so as ther dyed some times 2. or 3. of a
      day, in y<sup>e</sup> foresaid time; that of 100. &amp; odd persons,
      scarce 50. remained. And of these in y<sup>e</sup> time of most distres,
      ther was but 6. or 7. sound persons, who, to their great comendations be
      it spoken, spared no pains, night nor day, but with abundance of toyle and
      hazard of their owne health, fetched them woode, made them fires, drest
      them meat, made their beads, washed their lothsome cloaths, cloathed &amp;
      uncloathed them; in a word, did all y<sup>e</sup> homly &amp; necessarie
      offices for them w<sup>ch</sup> dainty &amp; quesie stomacks cannot endure
      to hear named; and all this willingly &amp; cherfully, without any
      grudging in y<sup>e</sup> least, shewing herein their true love unto their
      freinds &amp; bretheren. A rare example &amp; worthy to <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>be
      remembred. Tow of these 7. were M<sup>r</sup>. William Brewster, ther
      reverend Elder, &amp; Myles Standish, ther Captein &amp; military
      comander, unto whom my selfe, &amp; many others, were much beholden in our
      low &amp; sicke condition. And yet the Lord so upheld these persons, as in
      this generall calamity they were not at all infected either with sicknes,
      or lamnes. And what I have said of these, I may say of many others who
      dyed in this generall vissitation, &amp; others yet living, that whilst
      they had health, yea, or any strength continuing, they were not wanting to
      any that had need of them. And I doute not but their recompence is with y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I may not hear pass by an other remarkable passage not to be
      forgotten. As this calamitie fell among y<sup>e</sup> passengers that were
      to be left here to plant, and were hasted a shore and made to drinke
      water, that y<sup>e</sup> sea-men might have y<sup>e</sup> more bear, and
      one<a name="FNanchor_AK_37" id="FNanchor_AK_37"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_AK_37" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a> in his sicknes desiring
      but a small cann of beere, it was answered, that if he were their owne
      father he should have none; the disease begane to fall amongst them also,
      so as allmost halfe of their company dyed before they went away, and many
      of their officers and lustyest men, as y<sup>e</sup> boatson, gunner, 3.
      quarter-maisters, the cooke, &amp; others. At w<sup>ch</sup> y<sup>e</sup>
      m<sup>r</sup>. was something strucken and sent to y<sup>e</sup> sick a
      shore and tould y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> he should send for beer for
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>them
      that had need of it, though he drunke water homward bound. But now amongst
      his company [56] ther was farr another kind of carriage in this miserie
      then amongst y<sup>e</sup> passengers; for they that before had been boone
      companions in drinking &amp; joyllity in y<sup>e</sup> time of their
      health &amp; wellfare, begane now to deserte one another in this
      calamitie, saing they would not hasard ther lives for them, they should be
      infected by coming to help them in their cabins, and so, after they came
      to dye by it, would doe litle or nothing for them, but if they dyed let
      them dye. But shuch of y<sup>e</sup> passengers as were yet abord shewed
      them what mercy they could, w<sup>ch</sup> made some of their harts
      relente, as y<sup>e</sup> boatson (&amp; some others), who was a prowd
      yonge man, and would often curse &amp; scofe at y<sup>e</sup> passengers;
      but when he grew weak, they had compassion on him and helped him; then he
      confessed he did not deserve it at their hands, he had abused them in word
      &amp; deed. O! saith he, you, I now see, shew your love like Christians
      indeed one to another, but we let one another lye &amp; dye like doggs.
      Another lay cursing his wife, saing if it had not ben for her he had never
      come this unlucky viage, and anone cursing his felows, saing he had done
      this &amp; that, for some of them, he had spente so much, &amp; so much,
      amongst them, and they were now weary of him, and did not help him, having
      need. Another gave his companion all he had, if he died, to help <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>him in
      his weaknes; he went and got a litle spise &amp; made him a mess of meat
      once or twise, and because he dyed not so soone as he expected, he went
      amongst his fellows, &amp; swore y<sup>e</sup> rogue would cousen him, he
      would see him choaked before he made him any more meate; and yet y<sup>e</sup>
      pore fellow dyed before morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while y<sup>e</sup> Indians came skulking about them, and would
      sometimes show them selves aloofe of, but when any aproached near them,
      they would rune away. And once they stoale away their tools wher they had
      been at worke, &amp; were gone to diner. But about y<sup>e</sup> 16. <i>of
      March</i> a certaine Indian came bouldly amongst them, and spoke to them
      in broken English, which they could well understand, but marvelled at it.
      At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these
      parts, but belonged to y<sup>e</sup> eastrene parts, wher some
      English-ships came to fhish, with whom he was aquainted, &amp; could name
      sundrie of them by their names, amongst whom he had gott his language. He
      became proftable to them [57] in aquainting them with many things
      concerning y<sup>e</sup> state of y<sup>e</sup> cuntry in y<sup>e</sup>
      east-parts wher he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as
      also of y<sup>e</sup> people hear, of their names, number, &amp; strength;
      of their situation &amp; distance from this place, and who was cheefe
      amongst them. His name was <i>Samaset</i>; he tould them also of another
      Indian whos name was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span><i>Squanto</i>,
      a native of this place, who had been in England &amp; could speake better
      English then him selfe. Being, after some time of entertainmente &amp;
      gifts, dismist, a while after he came againe, &amp; 5. more with him,
      &amp; they brought againe all y<sup>e</sup> tooles that were stolen away
      before, and made way for y<sup>e</sup> coming of their great Sachem,
      called <i>Massasoyt</i>; who, about <i>4. or 5. days after</i>, came with
      the cheefe of his freinds &amp; other attendance, with the aforesaid <i>Squanto</i>.
      With whom, after frendly entertainment, &amp; some gifts given him, they
      made a peace with him (which hath now continued this 24. years) in these
      terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. That neither he nor any of his, should injurie or doe hurte to any of
      their peopl.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That if any of his did any hurte to any of theirs, he should send y<sup>e</sup>
      offender, that they might punish him.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. That if any thing were taken away from any of theirs, he should cause
      it to be restored; and they should doe y<sup>e</sup> like to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. If any did unjustly warr against him, they would aide him; if any did
      warr against them, he should aide them.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. He should send to his neighbours confederats, to certifie them of this,
      that they might not wrong them, but might be likewise comprised in y<sup>e</sup>
      conditions of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. That when ther men came to them, they should leave their bows &amp;
      arrows behind them. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      After these things he returned to his place caled <i>Sowams</i>, some 40.
      mile from this place, but <i>Squanto</i> continued with them, and was
      their interpreter, and was a spetiall instrument sent of God for their
      good beyond their expectation. He directed them how to set their corne,
      wher to take fish, and to procure other comodities, and was also their
      pilott to bring them to unknowne places for their profitt, and never left
      them till he dyed. He was a <i>native [58] of this place</i>, &amp; scarce
      any left alive besids him selfe. He was caried away with diverce others by
      one <i>Hunt</i>, a m<sup>r</sup>. of a ship, who thought to sell them for
      slaves in Spaine; but he got away for England, and was entertained by a
      marchante in London, &amp; imployed to New-foundland &amp; other parts,
      &amp; lastly brought hither into these parts by one M<sup>r</sup>. <i>Dermer</i>,
      a gentle-man imployed by Sr. Ferdinando Gorges &amp; others, for
      discovery, &amp; other designes in these parts. Of whom I shall say some
      thing, because it is mentioned in a booke set forth An<sup>o</sup>: 1622.
      by the Presidente &amp; Counsell for New-England,<a name="FNanchor_AL_38"
      id="FNanchor_AL_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_AL_38" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a>
      that he made y<sup>e</sup> peace betweene y<sup>e</sup> salvages of these
      parts &amp; y<sup>e</sup> English; of which this plantation, as it is
      intimated, had y<sup>e</sup> benefite. But what a peace it was, may apeare
      by what befell him &amp; his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      This M<sup>r</sup>. Dermer was hear the same year that these <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>people
      came, as apears by a relation written by him, &amp; given me by a friend,
      bearing date June 30. An<sup>o</sup>: 1620. And they came in Novemb<sup>r</sup>:
      following, so ther was but 4. months differance. In which relation to his
      honored freind, he hath these passages of this very place.

        I will first begine (saith he) w<sup>th</sup> that place from whence <i>Squanto</i>,
        or <i>Tisquantem</i>, was taken away; w<sup>ch</sup> in Cap: <i>Smiths
        mape</i> is called <i>Plimoth</i>: and I would that Plimoth had y<sup>e</sup>
        like comodities. I would that the first plantation might hear be seated,
        if ther come to the number of 50. persons, or upward. Otherwise at
        Charlton, because ther y<sup>e</sup> savages are lese to be feared. The
        <i>Pocanawkits</i>, which live to y<sup>e</sup> <i>west</i> of <i>Plimoth</i>,
        bear an inveterate malice to y<sup>e</sup> English, and are of more
        streingth then all y<sup>e</sup> savags from thence to Penobscote. Their
        desire of revenge was occasioned by an English man, who having many of
        them on bord, made a great slaughter with their murderers &amp; smale
        shot, when as (they say) they offered no injurie on their parts. Whether
        they were English or no, it may be douted; yet they beleeve they were,
        for y<sup>e</sup> Frenche have so possest them; for which cause <i>Squanto</i>
        can&#773;ot deney but they would have kiled me when I was at <i>Namasket</i>,
        had he not entreated hard for me. The soyle of y<sup>e</sup> borders of
        [59] this great bay, may be compared to most of y<sup>e</sup>
        plantations which I have seene in Virginia. The land is of diverce
        sorts; for <i>Patuxite</i> is a hardy but strong soyle, <i>Nawsel &amp;
        Saughtughtett</i> are for y<sup>e</sup> most part a blakish &amp; deep
        mould, much like that wher groweth y<sup>e</sup> best Tobaco in
        Virginia. In y<sup>e</sup> botume of y<sup>t</sup> great bay is store of
        Codd &amp; basse, or mulett, &amp;c.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      But above all he comends <i>Pacanawkite</i> for y<sup>e</sup> richest
      soyle, and much open ground fitt for English graine, &amp;c. <span

        <i>Massachussets</i> is about 9. leagues from <i>Plimoth</i>, &amp;
        situate in y<sup>e</sup> mids betweene both, is full of ilands &amp;
        peninsules very fertill for y<sup>e</sup> most parte.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      With sundrie shuch relations which I forbear to transcribe, being now
      better knowne then they were to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was taken prisoner by y<sup>e</sup> Indeans at <i>Manamoiak</i> (a
      place not farr from hence, now well knowne). He gave them what they
      demanded for his liberty, but when they had gott what they desired, they
      kept him still &amp; indevored to kill his men; but he was freed by
      seasing on some of them, and kept them bound till they gave him a cannows
      load of corne. Of which, see Purch: lib. 9. fol. 1778. But this was An<sup>o</sup>:
      1619.
    </p>
    <p>
      After y<sup>e</sup> writing of y<sup>e</sup> former relation he came to y<sup>e</sup>
      Ile of <i>Capawack</i> (which lyes south of this place in y<sup>e</sup>
      way to Virginia), and y<sup>e</sup> foresaid <i>Squanto</i> w<sup>th</sup>
      him, wher he going a shore amongst y<sup>e</sup> Indans to trad, as he
      used to doe, was betrayed &amp; assaulted by them, &amp; <i>all his men
      slaine, but one that kept the boat</i>; but him selfe gott abord very sore
      wounded, &amp; they had cut of his head upon y<sup>e</sup> cudy of his
      boat, had not y<sup>e</sup> man reskued him with a sword. And so they got
      away, &amp; made shift to gett into Virginia, wher he dyed; whether of his
      wounds or y<sup>e</sup> diseases of y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie, or both
      togeather, is uncertaine. [60] By all which it may appeare how farr these
      people were <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>from
      peace, and with what danger this plantation was begune, save as y<sup>e</sup>
      powerfull hand of the Lord did protect them. These things<a
      name="FNanchor_AM_39" id="FNanchor_AM_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM_39"
      class="fnanchor">[AM]</a> were partly the reason why they kept aloofe
      &amp; were so long before they came to the English. An other reason (as
      after them selvs made know&#773;) was how aboute 3. <i>years before</i>, a
      French-ship was cast away at <i>Cap-Codd</i>, but y<sup>e</sup> men gott
      ashore, &amp; saved their lives, and much of their victails, &amp; other
      goods; but after y<sup>e</sup> Indeans heard of it, they geathered
      togeather from these parts, and never left watching &amp; dogging them
      till they got advantage, and <i>kild them all but 3. or 4.</i> which they
      kept, &amp; sent from one Sachem to another, to make sporte with, and used
      them worse then slaves; (of which y<sup>e</sup> foresaid M<sup>r</sup>.
      Dermer redeemed 2. of them;) and they conceived this ship was now come to
      revenge it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, (as after was made knowne,) before they came to y<sup>e</sup>
      English to make freindship, they gott all the <i>Powachs</i> of y<sup>e</sup>
      cuntrie, for 3. days togeather, in a horid and divellish maner to curse
      &amp; execrate them with their cunjurations, which asembly &amp; service
      they held in a darke &amp; dismale swampe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to returne. The spring now approaching, it pleased God the mortalitie
      begane to cease amongst them, and y<sup>e</sup> sick and lame recovered
      apace, which put as it were new life into them; though they had <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>borne
      their sadd affliction with much patience &amp; contentednes, as I thinke
      any people could doe. But it was y<sup>e</sup> Lord which upheld them, and
      had beforehand prepared them; many having long borne y<sup>e</sup> yoake,
      yea from their youth. Many other smaler maters I omite, sundrie of them
      having been allready published in a Jurnall made by one of the company;
      and some other passages of jurneys and relations allredy published, to
      which I referr those that are willing to know them more perticulerly. And
      being now come to y<sup>e</sup> 25. of March I shall begine y<sup>e</sup>
      year 1621.
    </p>
    <p class="center break">
      <a name="a1621" id="a1621"></a>[61] <i>Anno. 1621.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      They now begane to dispatch y<sup>e</sup> ship away which brought them
      over, which lay tille aboute this time, or y<sup>e</sup> begining of
      Aprill. The reason on their parts why she stayed so long, was y<sup>e</sup>
      necessitie and danger that lay upon them, for it was well towards y<sup>e</sup>
      ende of Desember before she could land any thing hear, or they able to
      receive any thing ashore. Afterwards, y<sup>e</sup> 14. of Jan: the house
      which they had made for a generall randevoze by casulty fell afire, and
      some were faine to retire abord for shilter. Then the sicknes begane to
      fall sore amongst them, and y<sup>e</sup> weather so bad as they could not
      make much sooner any dispatch. Againe, the Gov<sup>r</sup> &amp; cheefe of
      them, seeing so many dye, and fall downe sick dayly, thought it no wisdom
      to send away the ship, their condition considered, and <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup>
      danger they stood in from y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, till they could procure
      some shelter; and therfore thought it better to draw some more charge upon
      them selves &amp; freinds, then hazard all. The m<sup>r</sup>. and sea-men
      likewise, though before they hasted y<sup>e</sup> passengers a shore to be
      goone, now many of their men being dead, &amp; of y<sup>e</sup> ablest of
      them, (as is before noted,) and of y<sup>e</sup> rest many lay sick &amp;
      weake, y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>. durst not put to sea, till he saw his
      men begine to recover, and y<sup>e</sup> hart of winter over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards they (as many as were able) began to plant ther corne, in which
      servise Squanto stood them in great stead, showing them both y<sup>e</sup>
      maner how to set it, and after how to dress &amp; tend it. Also he tould
      them excepte they gott fish &amp; set with it (in these old grounds) it
      would come to nothing, and he showed them y<sup>t</sup> in y<sup>e</sup>
      midle of Aprill they should have store enough come up y<sup>e</sup>
      brooke, by which they begane to build, and taught them how to take it, and
      wher to get other provissions necessary for them; all which they found
      true by triall &amp; experience. Some English seed they sew, as wheat
      &amp; pease, but it came not to good, eather by y<sup>e</sup> badnes of y<sup>e</sup>
      seed, or latenes of y<sup>e</sup> season, or both, or some other defecte.
    </p>
    <p>
      [62] In this month of <i>Aprill</i> whilst they were bussie about their
      seed, their Gov<sup>r</sup> (M<sup>r</sup>. John Carver) came out of y<sup>e</sup>
      feild very sick, it being a hott day; he complained greatly of his head,
      and lay downe, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>within
      a few howers his sences failed, so as he never spake more till he dyed,
      which was within a few days after. Whoss death was much lamented, and
      caused great heavines amongst them, as ther was cause. He was buried in y<sup>e</sup>
      best maner they could, with some vollies of shott by all that bore armes;
      and his wife, being a weak woman, dyed within 5. or 6. weeks after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after William Bradford was chosen Gove<sup>r</sup> in his stead,
      and being not yet recoverd of his ilnes, in which he had been near y<sup>e</sup>
      point of death, Isaak Allerton was chosen to be an Asistante unto him,
      who, by renewed election every year, continued sundry years togeather,
      which I hear note once for all.

      <i>May 12.</i> was y<sup>e</sup> first mariage in this place, which,
      according to y<sup>e</sup> laudable custome of the Low-Cuntries, in which
      they had lived, was thought most requisite to be performed by the
      magistrate, as being a civill thing, upon which many questions aboute
      inheritances doe depende, with other things most proper to their
      cognizans, and most consonante to y<sup>e</sup> scripturs, Ruth 4. and no
      wher found in y<sup>e</sup> gospell to be layed on y<sup>e</sup> ministers
      as a part of their office. "This decree or law about mariage was published
      by y<sup>e</sup> Stats of y<sup>e</sup> Low-Cuntries An<sup>o</sup>: 1590.
      That those of any religion, after lawfull and open publication, coming
      before y<sup>e</sup> magistrats, in y<sup>e</sup> Town or Stat-house, were
      to be orderly (by them) maried one to another." Petets <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>Hist,
      fol: 1029. And this practiss hath continued amongst, not only them, but
      hath been followed by all y<sup>e</sup> famous churches of Christ in these
      parts to this time,&mdash;An<sup>o</sup>: 1646.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haveing in some sorte ordered their bussines at home, it was thought meete
      to send some abroad to see their new friend Massasoyet, and to bestow upon
      him some gratuitie to bind him y<sup>e</sup> faster unto them; as also
      that hearby they might veiw y<sup>e</sup> countrie, and see in what maner
      he lived, what strength he had aboute him, and how y<sup>e</sup> ways were
      to his place, if at any time they should have occasion. So y<sup>e</sup>
      2. <i>of July</i> they sente M<sup>r</sup>. Edward Winslow &amp; M<sup>r</sup>.
      Hopkins, with y<sup>e</sup> foresaid Squanto for ther guid, who gave him a
      suite of cloaths, and a horsemans coate, with some other small things,
      which were kindly accepted; but they found but short com&#773;ons, and
      came both weary &amp; hungrie home. For y<sup>e</sup> Indeans used then to
      have nothing [63] so much corne as they have since y<sup>e</sup> English
      have stored them with their hows, and seene their industrie in breaking up
      new grounds therwith. <i>They found his place to be 40. miles from hence</i>,
      y<sup>e</sup> soyle good, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> people not many, being dead
      &amp; abundantly wasted in y<sup>e</sup> late great mortalitie which fell
      in all these parts aboute <i>three years</i> before y<sup>e</sup> coming
      of y<sup>e</sup> English, wherin thousands of them dyed, they not being
      able to burie one another; ther sculs and bones were found in many places
      lying still above <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>ground,
      where their houses &amp; dwellings had been; a very sad spectackle to
      behould. But they brought word that y<sup>e</sup> Narighansets lived but
      on y<sup>e</sup> other side of that great bay, &amp; were a strong people,
      &amp; many in number, living compacte togeather, &amp; had not been at all
      touched with this wasting plague.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aboute y<sup>e</sup> <i>later end of this month</i>, one John Billington
      lost him selfe in y<sup>e</sup> woods, &amp; wandered up &amp; downe some
      5. days, living on beries &amp; what he could find. At length he light on
      an Indean plantation, 20. mils south of this place, called <i>Manamet</i>,
      they conveid him furder of, to <i>Nawsett</i>, among those peopl that had
      before set upon y<sup>e</sup> English when they were costing, whilest y<sup>e</sup>
      ship lay at y<sup>e</sup> Cape, as is before noted. But y<sup>e</sup> Gove<sup>r</sup>
      caused him to be enquired for among y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, and at length
      Massassoyt sent word wher he was, and y<sup>e</sup> Gove<sup>r</sup> sent
      a shalop for him, &amp; had him delivered. Those people also came and made
      their peace; and they gave full satisfaction to those whose come they had
      found &amp; taken when they were at Cap-Codd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus ther peace &amp; aquaintance was prety well establisht w<sup>th</sup>
      the natives aboute them; and ther was an other Indean called <i>Hobamack</i>
      come to live amongst them, a proper lustie man, and a man of accounte for
      his vallour &amp; parts amongst y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, and continued very
      faithfull and constant to y<sup>e</sup> English till he dyed. He &amp;
      Squanto being gone upon bussines <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125"
      id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>amonge y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, at their
      returne (whether it was out of envie to them or malice to the English)
      ther was a Sachem called Corbitant, alyed to Massassoyte, but never any
      good friend to y<sup>e</sup> English to this day, mett with them at an
      Indean towne caled Namassakett 14. miles to y<sup>e</sup> west of this
      place, and begane to quarell w<sup>th</sup> [64] them, and offered to
      stabe Hobamack; but being a lusty man, he cleared him selfe of him, and
      came run&#773;ing away all sweating and tould y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
      what had befalne him, and he feared they had killed Squanto, for they
      threatened them both, and for no other cause but because they were freinds
      to y<sup>e</sup> English, and servisable unto them. Upon this y<sup>e</sup>
      Gove<sup>r</sup> taking counsell, it was conceivd not fitt to be borne;
      for if they should suffer their freinds &amp; messengers thus to be
      wronged, they should have none would cleave unto them, or give them any
      inteligence, or doe them serviss afterwards; but nexte they would fall
      upon them selves. Whereupon it was resolved to send y<sup>e</sup> Captaine
      &amp; 14. men well armed, and to goe &amp; fall upon them in y<sup>e</sup>
      night; and if they found that Squanto was kild, to cut of Corbitants head,
      but not to hurt any but those that had a hand in it. Hobamack was asked if
      he would goe &amp; be their guid, &amp; bring them ther before day. He
      said he would, &amp; bring them to y<sup>e</sup> house wher the man lay,
      and show them which was he. So they set forth y<sup>e</sup> 14. <i>of
      August</i>, and beset y<sup>e</sup> house round; the Captin giving <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>charg to
      let none pass out, entred y<sup>e</sup> house to search for him. But he
      was goone away that day, so they mist him; but understood y<sup>t</sup>
      Squanto was alive, &amp; that he had only threatened to kill him, &amp;
      made an offer to stabe him but did not. So they withheld and did no more
      hurte, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> people came trembling, &amp; brought them the
      best provissions they had, after they were aquainted by Hobamack what was
      only intended. Ther was 3. sore wounded which broak out of y<sup>e</sup>
      house, and asaid to pass through y<sup>e</sup> garde. These they brought
      home with them, &amp; they had their wounds drest &amp; cured, and sente
      home. After this they had many gratulations from diverce sachims, and much
      firmer peace; yea, those of y<sup>e</sup> Iles of Capawack sent to make
      frendship; and this Corbitant him selfe used y<sup>e</sup> mediation of
      Massassoyte to make his peace, but was shie to come neare them a longe
      while after.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, y<sup>e</sup> 18. of Septemb<sup>r</sup>: they sente out ther
      shalop to the Massachusets, with 10. men, and Squanto for their guid and
      [65] interpreter, to discover and veiw that bay, and trade with y<sup>e</sup>
      natives; the which they performed, and found kind entertainement. The
      people were much affraid of y<sup>e</sup> Tarentins, a people to y<sup>e</sup>
      eastward which used to come in harvest time and take away their corne,
      &amp; many times kill their persons. They returned in saftie, and brought
      home a good quanty of beaver, and made reporte of y<sup>e</sup> place,
      wishing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>they
      had been ther seated; (but it seems y<sup>e</sup> Lord, who assignes to
      all men y<sup>e</sup> bounds of their habitations, had apoynted it for an
      other use). And thus they found the Lord to be with them in all their
      ways, and to blesse their outgoings &amp; incom&#773;ings, for which let
      his holy name have y<sup>e</sup> praise for ever, to all posteritie.
    </p>
    <p>
      They begane now to gather in y<sup>e</sup> small harvest they had, and to
      fitte up their houses and dwellings against winter, being all well
      recovered in health &amp; strenght, and had all things in good plenty; for
      as some were thus imployed in affairs abroad, others were excersised in
      fishing, aboute codd, &amp; bass, &amp; other fish, of which y<sup>ey</sup>
      tooke good store, of which every family had their portion. All y<sup>e</sup>
      som&#773;er ther was no wante. And now begane to come in store of foule,
      as winter aproached, of which this place did abound when they came first
      (but afterward decreased by degrees). And besids water foule, ther was
      great store of wild Turkies, of which they tooke many, besids venison,
      &amp;c. Besids they had aboute a peck a meale a weeke to a person, or now
      since harvest, Indean corne to y<sup>t</sup> proportion. Which made many
      afterwards write so largly of their plenty hear to their freinds in
      England, which were not fained, but true reports.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Novemb<sup>r</sup>, about y<sup>e</sup> time twelfe month that them
      selves came, ther came in a small ship to them unexpected or loked for,<a
      name="FNanchor_AN_40" id="FNanchor_AN_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_AN_40"
      class="fnanchor">[AN]</a> in which came Mr. Cushman (so <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>much
      spoken of before) and with him 35. persons to remaine &amp; live in y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation; which did not a litle rejoyce them. And they when they came a
      shore and found all well, and saw plenty of vitails in every house, were
      no less glade. For most of them were lusty yonge men, and many of them
      wild enough, who litle considered whither or aboute what they wente, till
      they came into y<sup>e</sup> harbore at Cap-Codd, and ther saw nothing but
      a naked and barren place. They then begane to thinke what should become of
      them, if the people here were dead or cut of by y<sup>e</sup> Indeans.
      They begane to consulte (upon some speeches that some of y<sup>e</sup>
      sea-men had cast out) to take y<sup>e</sup> sayls from y<sup>e</sup> yeard
      least y<sup>e</sup> ship [66] should gett away and leave them ther. But y<sup>e</sup>
      m<sup>r</sup>. hereing of it, gave them good words, and tould them if any
      thing but well should have befallne y<sup>e</sup> people hear, he hoped he
      had vitails enough to cary them to Virginia, and whilst he had a bitt they
      should have their parte; which gave them good satisfaction. So they were
      all landed; but ther was not so much as bisket-cake or any other victialls<a
      name="FNanchor_AO_41" id="FNanchor_AO_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO_41"
      class="fnanchor">[AO]</a> for them, neither had they any beding, but some
      sory things they had in their cabins, nor pot, nor pan, to drese any meate
      in; nor overmany cloaths, for many of them had brusht away their coats
      &amp; cloaks at Plimoth as they came. But ther was sent over some
      burching-lane suits in y<sup>e</sup> ship, out of which they were <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>supplied.
      The plantation was glad of this addition of strenght, but could have wished
      that many of them had been of beter condition, and all of them beter
      furnished with provissions; but y<sup>t</sup> could not now be helpte.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this ship M<sup>r</sup>. Weston sent a large leter to M<sup>r</sup>.
      Carver, y<sup>e</sup> late Gove<sup>r</sup>, now deseased, full of
      complaints &amp; expostulations aboute former passagess at Hampton; and y<sup>e</sup>
      keeping y<sup>e</sup> shipe so long in y<sup>e</sup> country, and
      returning her without lading, &amp;c., which for brevitie I omite. The

        I durst never aquainte y<sup>e</sup> adventurers with y<sup>e</sup>
        alteration of y<sup>e</sup> conditions first agreed on betweene us,
        which I have since been very glad of, for I am well assured had they
        knowne as much as I doe, they would not have adventured a halfe-peny of
        what was necesary for this ship. That you sent no lading in the ship is
        wonderfull, and worthily distasted. I know you<sup>r</sup> weaknes was
        the cause of it, and I beleeve more weaknes of judgmente, then weaknes
        of hands. A quarter of y<sup>e</sup> time you spente in discoursing,
        arguing, &amp; consulting, would have done much more; but that is past,
        &amp;c. If you mean, bona fide, to performe the conditions agreed upon,
        doe us y<sup>e</sup> favore to coppy them out faire, and subscribe them
        with y<sup>e</sup> principall of your names. And likwise give us
        accounte as perticulerly as you can how our moneys were laid out. And
        then I shall be able to give them some satisfaction, whom I am now
        forsed with good words to shift of. And consider that y<sup>e</sup> life
        of the bussines depends on y<sup>e</sup> lading of this ship, which, if
        you doe to any good purpose, that I may be freed from y<sup>e</sup>

      This ship (caled y<sup>e</sup> Fortune) was speedily dispatcht away, being
      laden with good clapbord as full as she could stowe, and 2. hoggsheads of
      beaver and otter skins, which they gott with a few trifling comodities
      brought with them at first, being alltogeather unprovided for trade;
      neither was ther any amongst them that ever saw a beaver skin till they
      came hear, and were informed by Squanto. The fraight was estimated to be
      worth near 500<sup>li</sup>. M<sup>r</sup>. Cushman returned backe also
      with this ship, for so Mr. Weston &amp; y<sup>e</sup> rest had apoynted
      him, for their better information. And he doubted not, nor them selves
      neither, but they should have a speedy supply; considering allso how by M<sup>r</sup>.
      Cushmans perswation, and letters received from Leyden, wherin they willed
      them so to doe, they yeelded<a name="FNanchor_AP_42" id="FNanchor_AP_42"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_AP_42" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a> to y<sup>e</sup>
      afforesaid conditions, and subscribed them with <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>their hands. But it proved
      other wise, for Mr. Weston, who had made y<sup>e</sup> large promise in
      his leter, (as is before noted,) that if all y<sup>e</sup> rest should
      fall of, yet he would never quit y<sup>e</sup> bussines, but stick to
      them, if they yeelded to y<sup>e</sup> conditions, and sente some lading
      in y<sup>e</sup> ship; and of this M<sup>r</sup>. Cushman was confident,
      and confirmed y<sup>e</sup> same from his mouth, &amp; serious
      protestations to him selfe before he came. But all proved but wind, for he
      was y<sup>e</sup> first and only man that forsooke them, and that before
      he so much as heard of y<sup>e</sup> returne of this ship, or knew what
      was done; (so vaine is the confidence in man.) But of this more in its
      place.

      A leter in answer to his write to M<sup>r</sup>. Carver, was sente to him
      from y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>, of which so much as is pertenente to y<sup>e</sup>
      thing in hand I shall hear inserte.
    </p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        S<sup>r</sup>: Your large letter writen to M<sup>r</sup>. Carver, and
        dated y<sup>e</sup> 6. of July, 1621, I have received y<sup>e</sup> 10.
        of Novemb<sup>r</sup>, wherin (after y<sup>e</sup> apologie made for
        your selfe) you lay many heavie imputations upon him and us all.
        Touching him, he is departed this life, and now is at rest [68] in y<sup>e</sup>
        Lord from all those troubls and incoumbrances with which we are yet to
        strive. He needs not my appologie; for his care and pains was so great
        for y<sup>e</sup> commone good, both ours and yours, as that therwith
        (it is thought) he oppressed him selfe and shortened his days; of whose
        loss we cannot sufficiently complaine. At great charges in this
        adventure, I confess you have beene, and many losses may sustaine; but y<sup>e</sup>
        loss of his and many other honest and industrious mens lives, cannot be
        vallewed at any prise. Of y<sup>e</sup> one, ther may be hope of
        recovery, but <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup>
        other no recompence can make good. But I will not insiste in generalls,
        but come more perticulerly to y<sup>e</sup> things them selves. You
        greatly blame us for keping y<sup>e</sup> ship so long in y<sup>e</sup>
        countrie, and then to send her away emptie. She lay 5. weks at Cap-Codd,
        whilst with many a weary step (after a long journey) and the indurance
        of many a hard brunte, we sought out in the foule winter a place of
        habitation. Then we went in so tedious a time to make provission to
        sheelter us and our goods, aboute w<sup>ch</sup> labour, many of our
        armes &amp; leggs can tell us to this day we were not necligent. But it
        pleased God to vissite us then, with death dayly, and with so generall a
        disease, that the living were scarce able to burie the dead; and y<sup>e</sup>
        well not in any measure sufficiente to tend y<sup>e</sup> sick. And now
        to be so greatly blamed, for not fraighting y<sup>e</sup> ship, doth
        indeed goe near us, and much discourage us. But you say you know we will
        pretend weaknes; and doe you think we had not cause? Yes, you tell us
        you beleeve it, but it was more weaknes of judgmente, then of hands. Our
        weaknes herin is great we confess, therfore we will bear this check
        patiently amongst y<sup>e</sup> rest, till God send us wiser men. But
        they which tould you we spent so much time in discoursing &amp;
        consulting, &amp;c., their harts can tell their toungs, they lye. They
        cared not, so they might salve their owne sores, how they wounded
        others. Indeed, it is our callamitie that we are (beyound expectation)
        yoked with some ill conditioned people, who will never doe good, but
        corrupte and abuse others, &amp;c.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The rest of y<sup>e</sup> letter declared how they had subscribed those
      conditions according to his desire, and sente him y<sup>e</sup> former
      accounts very perticulerly; also how y<sup>e</sup> ship was laden, and in
      what condition their affairs stood; that y<sup>e</sup> coming of these
      [69] people would bring famine upon them unavoydably, if they <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>had not
      supply in time (as Mr. Cushman could more fully informe him &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
      rest of y<sup>e</sup> adventurers). Also that seeing he was now satisfied
      in all his demands, that offences would be forgoten, and he remember his
      promise, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      After y<sup>e</sup> departure of this ship, (which stayed not above 14.
      days,) the Gove<sup>r</sup> &amp; his assistante haveing disposed these
      late com&#773;ers into severall families, as y<sup>ey</sup> best could,
      tooke an exacte accounte of all their provissions in store, and
      proportioned y<sup>e</sup> same to y<sup>e</sup> number of persons, and
      found that it would not hould out above 6. months at halfe alowance, and
      hardly that. And they could not well give less this winter time till fish
      came in againe. So they were presently put to half alowance, one as well
      as an other, which begane to be hard, but they bore it patiently under
      hope of supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sone after this ships departure, y<sup>e</sup> great people of y<sup>e</sup>
      Narigansets, in a braving maner, sente a messenger unto them with a bundl
      of arrows tyed aboute with a great sneak-skine; which their interpretours
      tould them was a threatening &amp; a chaleng. Upon which y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>,
      with y<sup>e</sup> advice of others, sente them a round answere, that if
      they had rather have warre then peace, they might begine when they would;
      they had done them no wrong, neither did y<sup>ey</sup> fear them, or
      should they find them unprovided. And by another messenger sente y<sup>e</sup>
      sneake-skine back with bulits in it; but they <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>would not receive it, but
      sent it back againe. But these things I doe but mention, because they are
      more at large allready put forth in printe, by M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow, at
      y<sup>e</sup> requeste of some freinds. And it is like y<sup>e</sup>
      reason was their owne ambition, who, (since y<sup>e</sup> death of so many
      of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans,) thought to dominire &amp; lord it over y<sup>e</sup>
      rest, &amp; conceived y<sup>e</sup> English would be a barr in their way,
      and saw that Massasoyt took sheilter allready under their wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this made them y<sup>e</sup> more carefully to looke to them selves,
      so as they agreed to inclose their dwellings with a good strong pale, and
      make flankers in convenient places, with gates to shute, which were every
      night locked, and a watch kept, and when neede required ther was also
      warding in y<sup>e</sup> day time. And y<sup>e</sup> company was by y<sup>e</sup>
      Captaine and y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> [70] advise, devided into 4.
      squadrons, and every one had ther quarter apoynted them, unto which they
      were to repaire upon any suddane alarme. And if ther should be any crie of
      fire, a company were appointed for a gard, with muskets, whilst others
      quenchet y<sup>e</sup> same, to prevent Indean treachery. This was
      accomplished very cherfully, and y<sup>e</sup> towne impayled round by y<sup>e</sup>
      begining of March, in which evry family had a prety garden plote secured.
      And herewith I shall end this year. Only I shall remember one passage
      more, rather of mirth then of waight. One y<sup>e</sup> day called
      Chrismasday, y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> caled them out to worke, (as
      was used,) <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>but
      y<sup>e</sup> most of this new-company excused them selves and said it
      wente against their consciences to work on y<sup>t</sup> day. So y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> tould them that if they made it mater of conscience, he
      would spare them till they were better informed. So he led-away y<sup>e</sup>
      rest and left them; but when they came home at noone from their worke, he
      found them in y<sup>e</sup> streete at play, openly; some pitching y<sup>e</sup>
      barr, &amp; some at stoole-ball, and shuch like sports. So he went to
      them, and tooke away their implements, and tould them that was against his
      conscience, that they should play &amp; others worke. If they made y<sup>e</sup>
      keeping of it mater of devotion, let them kepe their houses, but ther
      should be no gameing or revelling in y<sup>e</sup> streets. Since which
      time nothing hath been atempted that way, at least openly.

    </p>
    <p>
      At y<sup>e</sup> spring of y<sup>e</sup> year they had apointed y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachusets to come againe and trade with them, and begane now to prepare
      for that vioag about y<sup>e</sup> later end of March. But upon some
      rumors heard, Hobamak, their Indean, tould them upon some jealocies he
      had, he feared they were joyned w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Narighansets
      and might betray them if they were not carefull. He intimated also some
      jealocie of Squanto, by what he gathered from some private whisperings
      betweene him and other Indeans. But [71] they resolved to proseede, and
      sente out their shalop with 10. of their cheefe <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>men aboute y<sup>e</sup>
      begining of Aprill, and both Squanto &amp; Hobamake with them, in regarde
      of y<sup>e</sup> jelocie betweene them. But they had not bene gone longe,
      but an Indean belonging to Squantos family came runing in seeming great
      fear, and tould them that many of y<sup>e</sup> Narihgansets, with
      Corbytant, and he thought also Massasoyte, were coming against them; and
      he gott away to tell them, not without danger. And being examined by y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup>, he made as if they were at hand, and would still be
      looking back, as if they were at his heels. At which the Governor caused
      them to take armes &amp; stand on their garde, and supposing y<sup>e</sup>
      boat to be still within hearing (by reason it was calme) caused a warning
      peece or 2. to be shote of, the which y<sup>ey</sup> heard and came in.
      But no Indeans apeared; watch was kepte all night, but nothing was scene.
      Hobamak was confidente for Massasoyt, and thought all was false; yet y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> caused him to send his wife privatly, to see what she
      could observe (pretening other occasions), but ther was nothing found, but
      all was quiet. After this they proseeded on their vioge to y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachusets, and had good trade, and returned in saftie, blessed be God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by the former passages, and other things of like nature, they begane
      to see y<sup>t</sup> Squanto sought his owne ends, and plaid his owne
      game, by putting y<sup>e</sup> Indeans in fear, and drawing gifts from
      them to enrich him selfe; making them beleeve he could stur up <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>warr
      against whom he would, &amp; make peece for whom he would. Yea, he made
      them beleeve they kept y<sup>e</sup> plague buried in y<sup>e</sup>
      ground, and could send it amongs whom they would, which did much terrifie
      the Indeans, and made them depend more on him, and seeke more to him then
      to Massasoyte, which proucured him envie, and had like to have cost him
      his life. For after y<sup>e</sup> discovery of his practises, Massasoyt
      sought it both privatly and openly; which caused him to stick close to y<sup>e</sup>
      English, &amp; never durst goe from them till he dyed. They also made good
      use of y<sup>e</sup> emulation y<sup>t</sup> grue betweene Hobamack and
      him, which made them cary more squarely. And y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
      seemed to countenance y<sup>e</sup> one, and y<sup>e</sup> Captaine y<sup>e</sup>
      other, by which they had better intelligence, and made them both more
      diligente.

      [72] Now in a maner their provissions were wholy spent, and they looked
      hard for supply, but none came. But about y<sup>e</sup> <i>later end of
      May</i>, they spied <i>a boat</i> at sea, which at first they thought had
      beene some Frenchman; but it proved a shalop which came from a ship which
      M<sup>r</sup>. Weston &amp; an other had set out a fishing, at a place
      called Damarins-cove, 40. leagues to y<sup>e</sup> eastward of them, wher
      were y<sup>t</sup> year many more ships come a fishing. This boat brought
      7. passengers and some letters, but no vitails, nor any hope of any. Some
      part of which I shall set downe.

        to send you a supply of men and provissions before shee come. They all
        answer they will doe great maters, when they hear good news. Nothing
        before; so faithfull, constant, &amp; carefull of your good, are your
        olde &amp; honest freinds, that if they hear not from you, they are like

        words, you will have a more favourable opinion of it, then some hear,
        wherof Pickering is one, who taxed me to mind my owne ends, which is in
        part true, &amp;c. <i>M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp and my selfe</i> bought <i>this
        litle ship</i>, and have set her out, partly, if it may be, to uphold<a
        name="FNanchor_AR_44" id="FNanchor_AR_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_AR_44"
        class="fnanchor">[AR]</a> y<sup>e</sup> plantation, as well to doe
        others good as our selves; and partly to gett up what we are formerly
        out; though we are otherwise censured, &amp;c. This is y<sup>e</sup>
        occasion we have sent <i>this ship</i> and these passengers, on our owne
        accounte; whom we desire you will frendly entertaine &amp; supply with
        shuch necesaries as you cane spare, and they wante, &amp;c. And among
        other things we pray you lend or sell them some seed corne, and if you
        have y<sup>e</sup> salt remaining of y<sup>e</sup> last year, that y<sup>u</sup>
        will let them have it for their presente use, and we will either pay you
        for it, or give you more when we have set our salt-pan to worke, which
        we desire may be set up in one of y<sup>e</sup> litle ilands in your
        bay, &amp;c. And because we intende, if God plase, [73] (and y<sup>e</sup>
        generallitie doe it not,) <i>to send within a month another shipe</i>,
        who, having discharged her passengers, <i>shal goe to Virginia</i>,
        &amp;c. And it may be we shall send a <i>small ship to abide with you</i>
        on y<sup>e</sup> coast, which I conceive may be a great help to y<sup>e</sup>
        plantation. To y<sup>e</sup> end our desire may be effected, which, I
        assure my selfe, will be also for your good, we pray you give them
        entertainmente in your houses y<sup>e</sup> time they shall be with<span

        that they may lose no time, but may presently goe in hand to fell trees
        &amp; cleave them, to y<sup>e</sup> end lading may be ready and our ship
        stay not.

        Some of y<sup>e</sup> adventurers have sent you hearwith all some
        directions for your furtherance in y<sup>e</sup> com&#773;one bussines,
        who are like those S<sup>t</sup>. James speaks of, y<sup>t</sup> bid
        their brother eat, and warme him, but give him nothing; so they bid you
        make salt, and uphold y<sup>e</sup> plantation, but send you no means
        wherwithall to doe it, &amp;c. By <i>y<sup>e</sup> next</i> we purpose
        <i>to send more people on our owne accounte</i>, and <i>to take a
        patente</i>; that if your peopl should be as unhumane as some of y<sup>e</sup>
        adventurers, not to admite us to dwell with them, which were extreme
        barbarisme, and which will never enter into my head to thinke you have
        any shuch Pickerings amongst you. Yet to satisfie our passengers I must
        of force doe it; and for some other reasons not necessary to be writen,
        &amp;c. I find y<sup>e</sup> generall so backward, and your freinds at
        Leyden so could, that I fear you must stand on your leggs, and trust (as

      All this was but could comfort to fill their hungrie bellies, and a
      slender performance of his former late promiss; and as litle did it either
      fill or warme them, as those y<sup>e</sup> Apostle James spake of, by him
      before mentioned. And well might it make them remember what y<sup>e</sup>

      Another leter was write from part of y<sup>e</sup> company of y<sup>e</sup>
      adventurers to the same purpose, and subscribed with 9. of their names,
      wherof M<sup>r</sup>. Westons &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamphs were tow.
      Thes things seemed strang unto them, seeing this unconstancie &amp;
      shufling; it made them to thinke ther was some misterie in y<sup>e</sup>
      matter. And therfore y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> concealed these letters
      from y<sup>e</sup> publick, only imparted them to some trustie freinds for
      advice, who concluded with him, that this tended to disband &amp; scater
      them (in regard of their straits); and if M<sup>r</sup>. Weston &amp;
      others, who seemed to rune in a perticuler way, should come over with
      shiping so provided as his letters did intimate, they most would fall to
      him, to y<sup>e</sup> prejudice of them selves &amp; y<sup>e</sup> rest of
      the adventurers,<a name="FNanchor_AS_45" id="FNanchor_AS_45"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_AS_45" class="fnanchor">[AS]</a> their freinds, from whom
      as yet they heard nothing. And it was doubted whether he <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>had not
      sente [75] over shuch a company in y<sup>e</sup> former ship, for shuch an
      end. Yet they tooke compassion of those 7. men which <i>this ship, which
      fished to y<sup>e</sup> eastward, had kept till planting time was over</i>,
      and so could set no corne; and allso wanting vitals, (for y<sup>ey</sup>
      turned them off w<sup>th</sup>out any, and indeed wanted for them selves,)
      neither was their salt-pan come, so as y<sup>ey</sup> could not performe
      any of those things which M<sup>r</sup>. Weston had apointed, and might
      have starved if y<sup>e</sup> plantation had not succoured them; who, in
      their wants, gave them as good as any of their owne. <i>The ship wente to
      Virginia</i>, wher they sould both ship &amp; fish, of which (it was
      conceived) M<sup>r</sup>. Weston had a very slender accounte.
    </p>

      <i>After this came another of his ships</i>, and brought letters dated y<sup>e</sup>

        conceite of so great a returne doth much animate y<sup>e</sup>

        of you, &amp; you of me, for that matter, &amp;c. Now though I have
        nothing to pretend as an adventurer amongst you, yet I will advise you a
        litle for your good, if you can apprehend it. I perceive &amp; know as
        well as another, y<sup>e</sup> dispositions of <i>your adventurers</i>,

        furder. Besids, <i>most of them are against the sending of them of
        Leyden, for whose cause this bussines was first begune</i>, and some of
        y<sup>e</sup> most religious (as M<sup>r</sup>. Greene by name) excepts
        against them. So y<sup>t</sup> my advice is (you may follow it if you
        please) that you forthwith break of your joynte stock, which you have
        warente to doe, both in law &amp; conscience, for y<sup>e</sup> most
        parte of y<sup>e</sup> adventurers have given way unto it by a former
        letter. And y<sup>e</sup> means you have ther, which I hope will be to
        some purpose by y<sup>e</sup> trade of this spring, may, with y<sup>e</sup>
        help of some freinds hear, bear y<sup>e</sup> charge of tr&#257;sporting
        those of Leyden; and when they are with you I make no question but by
        Gods help you will be able to subsist of your selves. But I shall leave

        I desired diverce of y<sup>e</sup> adventurers, as M<sup>r</sup>.
        Peirce, M<sup>r</sup>. Greene, &amp; others, if they had any thing to
        send you, either vitails or leters, to send them <i>by these ships</i>;
        and marvelling they sent not so much as a letter, I asked our passengers
        what leters they had, and with some dificultie one of them tould me he
        had one, which was delivered him with [76] great charge of secrecie; and
        for more securitie, to buy a paire of new-shoes, &amp; sow it betweene y<sup>e</sup>
        soles for fear of intercepting. I, taking y<sup>e</sup> leter, wondering
        what mistrie might be in it, broke it open, and found this treacherous
        letter subscribed by y<sup>e</sup> hands of M<sup>r</sup>. Pickering
        &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Greene. Wich leter had it come to you<sup>r</sup>
        hands without answer, might have caused y<sup>e</sup> hurt, if not y<sup>e</sup>
        ruine, of us all. For assuredly if you had followed their instructions,
        and shewed us that unkindness which they advise you unto, to hold us in
        distruste as enimise, &amp;c., it might have been an occasion to have
        set us togeather by y<sup>e</sup> eares, to y<sup>e</sup> distruction of
        us all. For I doe beleeve that in shuch a case, they knowing what
        bussines hath been betweene us, not only my brother, but others also,
        would have been violent, and heady against you, <span class="pagenum"><a

      [78] Thus all ther hops in regard of M<sup>r</sup>. Weston were layed in y<sup>e</sup>
      dust, and all his promised helpe turned into an empttie advice, which they
      apprehended was nether lawfull nor profitable for them to follow. And they
      were not only thus left destitute of help in their extreme wants, haveing
      neither vitails, nor any thing to trade with, but others prepared &amp;
      ready to glean up what y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie might have afforded for their
      releefe. As for those harsh censures &amp; susspitions intimated in y<sup>e</sup>
      former and following leters, they desired to judg as charitably and wisly
      of them as they could, waighing them in y<sup>e</sup> ballance of love and
      reason; and though they (in parte) came from godly &amp; loveing freinds,
      yet they conceived many things might arise from over deepe jealocie and
      fear, togeather with unmeete provocations, though they well saw M<sup>r</sup>.
      Weston pursued his owne ends, and was imbittered in spirite. <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>For after
      the receit of y<sup>e</sup> former leters, the Gov<sup>r</sup> received
      one from M<sup>r</sup>. Cushman, who went home in y<sup>e</sup> ship, and
      was allway intimate with M<sup>r</sup>. Weston, (as former passages
      declare), and it was much marveled that nothing was heard from him, all

      sending, for this leter was directed as y<sup>e</sup> leter of a wife to

        Beloved S<sup>r</sup>: I hartily salute you, with trust of your health,

        17. <i>of Feb</i>. Being robbed by y<sup>e</sup> French-men by y<sup>e</sup>
        way, and carried by them into France, and were kepte ther 15. days, and
        lost all y<sup>t</sup> we had that was worth taking; but thanks be to

        shortly, <i>I hope in June nexte, or before</i>. In y<sup>e</sup> mean

        Weston hath quite broken of from our company, through some discontents y<sup>t</sup>
        arose betwext him and some of our adventurers, &amp; hath sould all his
        adventurs, &amp; <i>hath now sent 3. smale ships for his perticuler

        must be blamed for their falts, much less can warrente their fidelitie.
        We are aboute to recover our losses in France. Our freinds at Leyden are
        well, and will come to you as many as can <i>this time</i>. I hope all
        will turne to y<sup>e</sup> best, wherfore I pray you be not

      All these things they pondred and well considered, yet concluded to give
      his men frendly entertainmente; partly in regard of M<sup>r</sup>. Weston
      him selfe, considering what he had been unto them, &amp; done for them,
      &amp; to some, more espetially; and partly in compassion to y<sup>e</sup>
      people, who were now come into a willdernes, (as them selves were,) and
      were by <i>y<sup>e</sup> ship</i> to be presently put a shore, (for she
      was <i>to cary other passengers to Virginia</i>, who lay at great charge,)
      and they were alltogeather unacquainted &amp; knew not what to doe. So as
      they had received his former company of 7. men, and vitailed them as their
      owne hitherto, so they also received <i>these</i> (being aboute 60. lusty
      men), and gave [79] housing for them selves and their goods; and many
      being sicke, they had y<sup>e</sup> best means y<sup>e</sup> place could
      aford them. They stayed hear y<sup>e</sup> most parte of y<sup>e</sup> som&#773;er
      till <i>y<sup>e</sup> ship came back againe from Virginia</i>. Then, by
      his direction, or those whom he set over them, they removed into y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachusset Bay, he having got a patente for some part ther, (by light of
      ther former discovery in leters sent home). Yet they left all ther sicke
      folke hear till they were setled and housed. But of ther victails they had
      not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>any,
      though they were in great wante, nor any thing els in recompence of any
      courtecie done them; neither did they desire it, for they saw they were an
      unruly company, and had no good govermente over them, and by disorder
      would soone fall into wants if M<sup>r</sup>. Weston came not y<sup>e</sup>

      By this boat y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> returned a thankfull answer, as
      was meete, and sent a boate of their owne with them, which was piloted by
      them, in which M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow was sente to procure what
      provissions he could of y<sup>e</sup> ships, who was kindly received by y<sup>e</sup>
      foresaid gentill-man, who not only spared what he [90<a
      name="FNanchor_AW_49" id="FNanchor_AW_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_AW_49"
      class="fnanchor">[AW]</a>] could, but writ to others to doe y<sup>e</sup>
      like. By which means he gott some good quantitie and returned in saftie,
      by which y<sup>e</sup> plantation had a duble benefite, first, a present
      refreshing by y<sup>e</sup> food brought, and secondly, they knew y<sup>e</sup>
      way to those parts for their benifite hearafter. But what was gott, &amp;
      this small boat brought, being devided among so many, came but to a litle,
      yet by Gods blesing it upheld them till harvest. It arose but to a quarter
      of a pound of bread a day to each person; and y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
      caused it to be dayly given them, otherwise, had it been in their owne
      custody, they would have eate it up &amp; then starved. But thus, with
      what els they could get, they made pretie shift till corne was ripe.

      This som&#773;er they builte a fort with good timber, both strong &amp;
      comly, which was of good defence, made with a flate rofe &amp; batllments,
      on which their ordnance were mounted, and wher they kepte constante watch,
      espetially in time of danger. It served them allso for a meeting house,
      and was fitted accordingly for that use. It was a great worke for them in
      this weaknes and time of wants; but y<sup>e</sup> deanger of y<sup>e</sup>
      time required it, and both y<sup>e</sup> continuall rumors of y<sup>e</sup>
      fears from y<sup>e</sup> Indeans hear, espetially y<sup>e</sup>
      Narigansets, and also y<sup>e</sup> hearing of that great massacre in
      Virginia, made all hands willing to despatch y<sup>e</sup> same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now y<sup>e</sup> wellcome time of harvest aproached, in which all had
      their hungrie bellies filled. But it arose but to a litle, in comparison
      of a full years supplie; partly by reason they were not yet well aquainted
      with y<sup>e</sup> man&#773;er of Indean corne, (and they had no other,)
      allso their many other imployments, but cheefly their weaknes for wante of
      food, to tend it as they should have done. Also much was stolne both by
      night &amp; day, before it became scarce eatable, &amp; much more
      afterward. And though many were well whipt (when they were taken) for a
      few ears of corne, yet hunger made others (whom conscience did not
      restraine) to venture. So as it well appeared y<sup>e</sup> famine must
      still insue y<sup>e</sup> next year allso, if not some way prevented, or
      supplie should faile, to which they durst not trust. Markets there was
      none to goe too, but <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>only
      y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, and they had no trading comodities. Behold now
      another providence of God; a ship comes into y<sup>e</sup> [91] harbor,
      one Captain Jons being cheefe therin. They were set out by some marchants
      to discovere all y<sup>e</sup> harbors betweene this &amp; Virginia, and y<sup>e</sup>
      shoulds of Cap-Cod, and to trade along y<sup>e</sup> coast wher they
      could. This ship had store of English-beads (which were then good trade)
      and some knives, but would sell none but at dear rates, and also a good
      quantie togeather. Yet they weere glad of y<sup>e</sup> occasion, and
      faine to buy at any rate; they were faine to give after y<sup>e</sup> rate
      of cento per cento, if not more, and yet pay away coat-beaver at 3<sup>s</sup>.
      per<sup>li</sup>, which in a few years after yeelded 20<sup>s</sup>. By
      this means they were fitted againe to trade for beaver &amp; other things,
      and intended to buy what corne they could.

      But I will hear take liberty to make a litle digression. Ther was in <i>this

      [92] <i>Shortly after harvest</i> M<sup>r</sup>. Westons people who were
      now seated at y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, and by disorder (as it seems)
      had made havock of their provissions, begane now to perceive that want
      would come upon them. And hearing that they hear had bought trading
      comodities &amp; intended to trade for corne, they write to y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> and desired they might joyne with them, and they would
      imploy their small ship in y<sup>e</sup> servise; and furder requested
      either to lend or sell them so much of their trading comodities as their
      part might come to, and they would undertake to make paymente when M<sup>r</sup>.
      Weston, or their supply, should come. The Gov<sup>r</sup> condesended upon
      equall terms of agreemente, thinkeing to goe aboute y<sup>e</sup> Cap to y<sup>e</sup>
      southward with y<sup>e</sup> ship, wher some store of corne might be got.
      Althings being provided, Captaint Standish was <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>apointed to goe with them,
      and Squanto for a guid &amp; interpreter, about y<sup>e</sup> <i>latter
      end of September</i>; but y<sup>e</sup> winds put them in againe, &amp;
      putting out y<sup>e</sup> 2. time, he fell sick of a feavor, so y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> wente him selfe. But they could not get aboute y<sup>e</sup>
      should of Cap-Cod, for flats &amp; breakers, neither could Squanto directe
      them better, nor y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>. durst venture any further,
      so they put into Manamoyack Bay and got w<sup>t</sup><a
      name="FNanchor_AX_50" id="FNanchor_AX_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_AX_50"
      class="fnanchor">[AX]</a> they could ther. In this place Squanto fell sick
      of an Indean feavor, bleeding much at y<sup>e</sup> nose (which y<sup>e</sup>
      Indeans take for a simptome of death), and within a few days dyed ther;
      desiring y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> to pray for him, that he might goe
      to y<sup>e</sup> Englishmens God in heaven, and bequeathed sundrie of his
      things to sundry of his English freinds, as remembrances of his love; of
      whom they had a great loss. They got in this vioage, in one place &amp;
      other, about 26. or 28. hogsheads of corne &amp; beans, which was more
      then the Indeans could well spare in these parts, for y<sup>e</sup> set
      but a litle till they got English hows. And so were faine to returne,
      being sory they could not gett about the Cap, to have been better laden.
      After ward y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> tooke a few men &amp; wente to y<sup>e</sup>
      inland places, to get what he could, and to fetch it home at y<sup>e</sup>
      spring, which did help them something.
    </p>
    <p>
      [93] After these things, in <i>Feb</i>: a messenger came from John
      Sanders, who was left cheefe over M<sup>r</sup>. Weston's men in y<sup>e</sup>
      bay of Massachusets, who brought a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156"

      falen into; and he would have borrowed a <ins title="hh">&#295;&#295;</ins>
      of corne of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, but they would lend him none. He
      desired advice whether he might not take it from them by force to succore
      his men till he came from y<sup>e</sup> eastward, whither he was going.
      The Gov<sup>r</sup> &amp; rest deswaded him by all means from it, for it
      might so exasperate the Indeans as might endanger their saftie, and all of
      us might smart for it; for they had already heard how they had so wronged
      y<sup>e</sup> Indeans by stealing their corne, &amp;c. as they were much
      incensed against them. Yea, so base were some of their own company, as
      they wente &amp; tould y<sup>e</sup> Indeans y<sup>t</sup> their Gov<sup>r</sup>
      was purposed to come and take their corne by force. The which with other
      things made them enter into a conspiracie against y<sup>e</sup> English,
      of which more in y<sup>e</sup> nexte. Hear with I end this year.

      It may be thought strang that these people should fall to these
      extremities in so short a time, being left competently provided when y<sup>e</sup>
      ship left them, and had an addition by that moyetie of corn that was got
      by trade, besids much they gott of y<sup>e</sup> Indans wher they lived,
      by one means &amp; other. It must needs be their great disorder, for they
      spent excesseivly whilst they had, or could get it; and, it may be, wasted
      parte away among y<sup>e</sup> Indeans (for he y<sup>t</sup> was their
      cheef <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>was
      taxed by some amongst them for keeping Indean women, how truly I know
      not). And after they begane to come into wants, many sould away their
      cloathes and bed coverings; others (so base were they) became servants to
      y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, and would cutt them woode &amp; fetch them water,
      for a cap full of corne; others fell to plaine stealing, both night &amp;
      day, from y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, of which they greevosly complained. In y<sup>e</sup>
      end, they came to that misery, that some starved &amp; dyed with could
      &amp; hunger. One in geathering shell-fish was so weake as he stuck fast
      in y<sup>e</sup> mudd, and was found dead in y<sup>e</sup> place. At last
      most of them left their dwellings &amp; scatered up &amp; downe in y<sup>e</sup>
      [94] woods, &amp; by y<sup>e</sup> water sids, wher they could find ground
      nuts &amp; clames, hear 6. and ther ten. By which their cariages they
      became contemned &amp; scorned of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, and they begane
      greatly to insulte over them in a most insolente maner; insomuch, many
      times as they lay thus scatered abrod, and had set on a pot with ground
      nuts or shell-fish, when it was ready the Indeans would come and eate it
      up; and when night came, wheras some of them had a sorie blanket, or such
      like, to lappe them selves in, the Indeans would take it and let y<sup>e</sup>
      other lye all nighte in the could; so as their condition was very
      lamentable. Yea, in y<sup>e</sup> end they were faine to hange one of
      their men, whom they could not reclaime from stealing, to give y<sup>e</sup>
      Indeans contente.

      Whilst things wente in this maner with them, y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
      &amp; people hear had notice y<sup>t</sup> Massasoyte ther freind was sick
      &amp; near unto death. They sent to vissete him, and withall sente him
      such comfortable things as gave him great contente, and was a means of his
      recovery; upon which occasion he discovers y<sup>e</sup> conspiracie of
      these Indeans, how they were resolved to cutt of M<sup>r</sup>. Westons
      people, for the continuall injuries they did them, &amp; would now take
      opportunitie of their weaknes to doe it; and for that end had conspired
      with other Indeans their neighbours their aboute. And thinking the people
      hear would revenge their death, they therfore thought to doe y<sup>e</sup>
      like by them, &amp; had solisited him to joyne with them. He advised them
      therfore to prevent it, and that speedly by taking of some of y<sup>e</sup>
      cheefe of them, before it was to late, for he asured them of y<sup>e</sup>
      truth hereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      This did much trouble them, and they tooke it into serious delibration,
      and found upon examenation other evidence to give light hear unto, to
      longe hear to relate. In y<sup>e</sup> mean time, came one of them from y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachucets, with a small pack at his back; and though he knew not a
      foote of y<sup>e</sup> way, yet he got safe hither, but lost his way,
      which was well for him, for he was pursued, and so was mist. He tould them
      hear how all things stood amongst them, and that he durst stay no longer,
      he apprehended they (by what he observed) would be all knokt in y<sup>e</sup>
      head shortly. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>This
      made them make y<sup>e</sup> more hast, &amp; dispatched a boate away w<sup>th</sup>
      Capten Standish &amp; some men, who found them in a miserable condition,
      out of which he rescued them, and helped them to some releef, cut of some
      few of y<sup>e</sup> cheefe conspirators, and, according to his order,
      offered to bring them all hither if they thought good; and they should
      fare no worse then them selves, till M<sup>r</sup>. Weston or some supplie
      came to them. Or, if any other course liked them better, he was to doe
      them any helpfullnes he could. They thanked him &amp; y<sup>e</sup> rest.
      But most of them desired he would help them with some corne, and they
      would goe with their smale ship to y<sup>e</sup> eastward, wher hapily
      they might here of M<sup>r</sup>. Weston, or some supply from him, seing y<sup>e</sup>
      time of y<sup>e</sup> year was for fishing ships to [95] be in y<sup>e</sup>
      land. If not, they would worke among y<sup>e</sup> fishermen for their
      liveing, and get ther passage into England, if they heard nothing from M<sup>r</sup>.
      Weston in time. So they shipped what they had of any worth, and he got
      them all y<sup>e</sup> corne he could (scarce leaving to bring him home),
      and saw them well out of the bay, under saile at sea, and so came home,
      not takeing y<sup>e</sup> worth of a peny of any thing that was theirs. I
      have but touched these things breefly, because they have allready been
      published in printe more at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was y<sup>e</sup> end of these that some time bosted of their
      strength, (being all able lustie men,) and what <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>they would doe &amp; bring
      to pass, in comparison of y<sup>e</sup> people hear, who had many women
      &amp; children and weak ons amongst them; and said at their first arivall,
      when they saw the wants hear, that they would take an other course, and
      not to fall into shuch a condition, as this simple people were come too.
      But a mans way is not in his owne power; God can make y<sup>e</sup> weake
      to stand; let him also that standeth take heed least he fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after, M<sup>r</sup>. Weston came over with some of y<sup>e</sup>
      fishermen, under another name, and y<sup>e</sup> disguise of a
      blacke-smith, were he heard of y<sup>e</sup> ruine and disolution of his
      colony. He got a boat and with a man or 2. came to see how things were.
      But by y<sup>e</sup> way, for wante of skill, in a storme, he cast away
      his shalop in y<sup>e</sup> botome of y<sup>e</sup> bay between Meremek
      river &amp; Pascataquack, &amp; hardly escaped with life, and afterwards
      fell into the hands of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, who pillaged him of all he
      saved from the sea, &amp; striped him out of all his cloaths to his
      shirte. At last he got to Pascataquack, &amp; borrowed a suite of cloaths,
      and got means to come to Plimoth. A strang alteration ther was in him to
      such as had seen &amp; known him in his former florishing condition; so
      uncertaine are y<sup>e</sup> mutable things of this unstable world. And
      yet men set their harts upon them, though they dayly see y<sup>e</sup>
      vanity therof.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many passages, and much discourse, (former <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>things boyling in his mind,
      but bit in as was discernd,) he desired to borrow some beaver of them; and
      tould them he had hope of a ship &amp; good supply to come to him, and
      then they should have any thing for it they stood in neede of. They gave
      litle credite to his supplie, but pitied his case, and remembered former
      curtesies. They tould him he saw their wants, and they knew not when they
      should have any supply; also how y<sup>e</sup> case stood betweene them
      &amp; their adventurers, he well knew; they had not much bever, &amp; if
      they should let him have it, it were enoughe to make a mutinie among y<sup>e</sup>
      people, seeing ther was no other means to procure them foode which they so
      much wanted, &amp; cloaths allso. Yet they tould him they would help him,
      considering his necessitie, but must doe it secretly for y<sup>e</sup>
      former reasons. So they let him have 100. beaver-skins, which waighed 170<sup>li</sup>.
      odd pounds. Thus they helpt him when all y<sup>e</sup> world faild him,
      and with this means he went againe to y<sup>e</sup> ships, and stayed his
      small ship &amp; some of his men, &amp; bought provissions and fited him
      selfe; and it was y<sup>e</sup> only foundation [96] of his after course.
      But he requited them ill, for he proved after a bitter enimie unto them
      upon all occasions, and never repayed them any thing for it, to this day,
      but reproches and evill words. Yea, he divolged it to some that were none
      of their best freinds, whilst he yet had y<sup>e</sup> beaver in his boat;
      that he could now set them all togeather by <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup> ears, because
      they had done more then they could answer, in letting him have this
      beaver, and he did not spare to doe what he could. But his malice could
      not prevaile.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this whille no supply was heard of, neither knew they when they might
      expecte any. So they begane to thinke how they might raise as much corne
      as they could, and obtaine a beter crope then they had done, that they
      might not still thus languish in miserie. At length, after much debate of
      things, the Gov<sup>r</sup> (with y<sup>e</sup> advise of y<sup>e</sup>
      cheefest amongest them) gave way that they should set corne every man for
      his owne perticuler, and in that regard trust to them selves; in all other
      things to goe on in y<sup>e</sup> generall way as before. And so assigned
      to every family a parcell of land, according to the proportion of their
      number for that end, only for present use (but made no devission for
      inheritance), and ranged all boys &amp; youth under some familie. This had
      very good success; for it made all hands very industrious, so as much more
      corne was planted then other waise would have bene by any means y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> or any other could use, and saved him a great deall of
      trouble, and gave farr better contente. The women now wente willingly into
      y<sup>e</sup> feild, and tooke their litle-ons with them to set corne,
      which before would aledg weaknes, and inabilitie; whom to have compelled
      would have bene thought great tiranie and oppression.

      The experience that was had in this com&#773;one course and condition,
      tried sundrie years, and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince
      the vanitie of that conceite of Platos &amp; other ancients, applauded by
      some of later times;&mdash;that y<sup>e</sup> taking away of propertie,
      and bringing in com&#773;unitie into a comone wealth, would make them
      happy and florishing; as if they were wiser then God. For this comunitie
      (so farr as it was) was found to breed much confusion &amp; discontent,
      and retard much imploym&#275;t that would have been to their benefite and
      comforte. For y<sup>e</sup> yong-men that were most able and fitte for
      labour &amp; service did repine that they should spend their time &amp;
      streingth to worke for other mens wives and children, with out any
      recompence. The strong, or man of parts, had no more in devission of
      victails &amp; cloaths, then he that was weake and not able to doe a
      quarter y<sup>e</sup> other could; this was thought injuestice. The aged
      and graver men to be ranked and [97] equalised in labours, and victails,
      cloaths, &amp;c., with y<sup>e</sup> meaner &amp; yonger sorte, thought it
      some indignite &amp; disrespect unto them. And for mens wives to be
      commanded to doe servise for other men, as dresing their meate, washing
      their cloaths, &amp;c., they deemd it a kind of slaverie, neither could
      many husbands well brooke it. Upon y<sup>e</sup> poynte all being to have
      alike, and all to doe alike, they thought them selves in y<sup>e</sup>
      like condition, and one as good as another; and so, if it did not cut of
      those <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>relations
      that God hath set amongest men, yet it did at least much diminish and take
      of y<sup>e</sup> mutuall respects that should be preserved amongst them.
      And would have bene worse if they had been men of another condition. Let
      none objecte this is men's corruption, and nothing to y<sup>e</sup> course
      it selfe. I answer, seeing all men have this corruption in them, God in
      his wisdome saw another course fiter for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to returne. After this course setled, and by that their cor&#773;e was
      planted, all ther victails were spente, and they were only to rest on Gods
      providence; at night not many times knowing wher to have a bitt of any
      thing y<sup>e</sup> next day. And so, as one well observed, had need to
      pray that God would give them their dayly brade, above all people in y<sup>e</sup>
      world. Yet they bore these wants with great patience &amp; allacritie of
      spirite, and that for so long a time as for y<sup>e</sup> most parte of 2.
      years; which makes me remember what Peter Martire writs, (in magnifying y<sup>e</sup>
      Spaniards) in his 5. Decade, pag. 208. <i>They</i> (saith he) <i>led a
      miserable life for 5. days togeather, with y<sup>e</sup> parched graine of
      maize only, and that not to saturitie</i>; and then concluds, <i>that
      shuch pains, shuch labours, and shuch hunger, he thought none living which
      is not a Spaniard could have endured</i>. But alass! these, when they had
      maize (y<sup>t</sup> is, Indean corne) they thought it as good as a feast,
      and wanted not only for 5. days togeather, but some time 2. or 3. months
      togeather, and neither had <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165"
      id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>bread nor any kind of corne. Indeed, in an
      other place, in his 2. Decade, page 94. he mentions how others of them
      were worse put to it, wher they were faine to eate doggs, toads, and dead
      men, and so dyed almost all. From these extremities the<a
      name="FNanchor_AY_51" id="FNanchor_AY_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_AY_51"
      class="fnanchor">[AY]</a> Lord in his goodnes kept these his people, and
      in their great wants preserved both their lives and healthes; let his name
      have y<sup>e</sup> praise. Yet let me hear make use of his conclusion,
      which in some sorte may be applied to this people: <i>That with their
      miseries they opened a way to these new-lands; and after these stormes,
      with what ease other men came to inhabite in them, in respecte of y<sup>e</sup>
      calamities these men suffered; so as they seeme to goe to a bride feaste
      wher all things are provided for them.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      They haveing but one boat left and she not over well fitted, they were
      devided into severall companies, 6. or 7. to a gangg or company, and so
      wente out with a nett they had bought, to take bass &amp; such like fish,
      by course, every company knowing their turne. No sooner was y<sup>e</sup>
      boate discharged [98] of what she brought, but y<sup>e</sup> next company
      tooke her and wente out with her. Neither did they returne till they had
      cauight something, though it were 5. or 6. days before, for they knew ther
      was nothing at home, and to goe home emptie would be a great
      discouragemente to y<sup>e</sup> rest. Yea, they strive who should doe
      best. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>If
      she stayed longe or got litle, then all went to seeking of shel-fish,
      which at low-water they digged out of y<sup>e</sup> sands. And this was
      their living in y<sup>e</sup> som&#773;er time, till God sente y<sup>m</sup>
      beter; &amp; in winter they were helped with ground-nuts and foule. Also
      in y<sup>e</sup> som&#773;er they gott now &amp; then a dear; for one or

      At length they received some leters from y<sup>e</sup> adventurers, too
      long and tedious hear to record, by which they heard of their furder

      This ship was brought by M<sup>r</sup>. John Peirce, and set out at his

      goods the company sent in her, he tooke in for fraught, for which they
      agreed with him to be delivered hear. This was he in whose name their <i>first
      patente</i> was taken, by reason of aquaintance, and some aliance that
      some of their freinds had with him. But his name was only used in trust.
      But when he saw they were hear hopfully thus seated, and by y<sup>e</sup>
      success God gave them had obtained y<sup>e</sup> favour of y<sup>e</sup>
      Counsell of New-England, he goes and sues to them for <i>another patent</i>
      of much larger extente (in their names), which was easily obtained. But he
      mente to keep it to him selfe and alow them what he pleased, to hold of
      him as tenants, and sue to his courts as cheefe Lord, as will appear by
      that which follows. But y<sup>e</sup> Lord marvelously crost him; for
      after this first returne, and y<sup>e</sup> charge above mentioned, when
      shee was againe fitted, he pesters him selfe and taks in more passengers,

        part with his royall Lordship, and y<sup>e</sup> high-rate he set it at,
        which was 500<sup>li</sup>. which cost him but 50<sup>li</sup>., maks
        many speake and judg hardly of him. The company are out for goods in his
        ship, with charge aboute y<sup>e</sup> passengers, 640<sup>li</sup>.,
        &amp;c.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have agreed with 2. marchants for a ship of 140. tunes, caled y<sup>e</sup>
        <i>Anne</i>, which is to be ready y<sup>e</sup> last of this month, to
        bring 60. passengers &amp; 60. tune of goods, &amp;c.

      This was dated Aprill 9. 1623.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were ther owne words and judgmente of this mans dealing &amp;
      proceedings; for I thought it more meete to render them in theirs then my
      owne words. And yet though ther was never got other recompence then the
      resignation of this patente, and y<sup>e</sup> shares he had in adventure,
      for all y<sup>e</sup> former great sumes, he was never quiet, but sued
      them in most of y<sup>e</sup> cheefe <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>courts in England, and when
      he was still cast, brought it to y<sup>e</sup> Parlemente. But he is now
      dead, and I will leave him to y<sup>e</sup> Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ship suffered y<sup>e</sup> greatest extreemitie at sea at her 2.
      returne, that one shall lightly hear of, to be saved; as I have been
      informed by M<sup>r</sup>. William Peirce who was then m<sup>r</sup>. of
      her, and many others that were passengers in her. It was aboute y<sup>e</sup>
      <i>midle of Feb</i>: The storme was for y<sup>e</sup> most parte of 14.
      days, but for 2. or 3. days &amp; nights togeather in most violent
      extremitie. After they had cut downe their mast, y<sup>e</sup> storme beat
      of their round house and all their uper works; 3. men had worke enough at
      y<sup>e</sup> helme, and he that cund y<sup>e</sup> ship before y<sup>e</sup>
      sea, was faine [100] to be bound fast for washing away; the seas did so
      over-rake them, as many times those upon y<sup>e</sup> decke knew not
      whether they were within bord or withoute; and once she was so foundered
      in y<sup>e</sup> sea as they all thought she would never rise againe. But
      yet y<sup>e</sup> Lord preserved them, and brought them at last safe to <i>Ports-mouth</i>,
      to y<sup>e</sup> wonder of all men y<sup>t</sup> saw in what a case she
      was in, and heard what they had endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      About y<sup>e</sup> later end of <i>June</i> came in a ship, with Captaine
      Francis West, who had a comission to be admirall of New-England, to
      restraine interlopers, and shuch fishing ships as came to fish &amp; trade
      without a licence from y<sup>e</sup> Counsell of New-England, for which
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>they
      should pay a round sume of money. But he could doe no good of them, for
      they were to stronge for him, and he found y<sup>e</sup> fisher men to be
      stuberne fellows. And their owners, upon complainte made to y<sup>e</sup>
      Parlemente, procured an order y<sup>t</sup> fishing should be free. He
      tould y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> they spooke with a ship at sea, and
      were abord her, y<sup>t</sup> was coming for this plantation, in which
      were sundrie passengers, and they marvelled she was not arrived, fearing
      some miscariage; for they lost her in a storme that fell shortly after
      they had been abord. Which relation filled them full of fear, yet mixed
      with hope. The m<sup>r</sup>. of this ship had some 2. &#295;&#295; of
      pease to sell, but seeing their wants, held them at 9<sup>li</sup>.
      sterling a hoggshead, &amp; under 8<sup>li</sup>. he would not take, and
      yet would have beaver at an under rate. But they tould him they had lived
      so long with out, and would doe still, rather then give so unreasonably.
      So they went from hence to Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_AZ_52"

      About 14. days after came in this ship, caled y<sup>e</sup> <i>Anne</i>,
      wherof M<sup>r</sup>. William Peirce was m<sup>r</sup>., and aboute a
      weeke or 10. days after came in y<sup>e</sup> pinass which in foule
      weather they lost at sea, a fine new vessell of about 44. tune, which y<sup>e</sup>
      company had builte to stay in the cuntrie. They brought about 60. persons
      for y<sup>e</sup> generall, some of them being very usefull persons, and
      became good members to y<sup>e</sup> body, and some were y<sup>e</sup>
      wives and children of shuch as were hear allready. And some were so bad,
      as they were faine to be at charge to send them home againe y<sup>e</sup>
      next year. Also, besids these ther came a company, that did not belong to
      y<sup>e</sup> generall body, but came one<a name="FNanchor_BA_53"
      id="FNanchor_BA_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_BA_53" class="fnanchor">[BA]</a>
      their perticuler, and were to have lands assigned them, and be for them
      selves, yet to be subjecte to y<sup>e</sup> generall Goverment; <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>which
      caused some diferance and disturbance [101] amongst them, as will after
      appeare. I shall hear againe take libertie to inserte a few things out of
      shuch leters as came in this shipe, desiring rather to manefest things in
      ther words and apprehentions, then in my owne, as much as may be, without
      tediousness.

        Beloved freinds, I kindly salute you all, with trust of your healths
        &amp; wellfare, being right sorie y<sup>t</sup> no supplie hath been
        made to you all this while; for defence wher of, I must referr you to
        our generall leters. Naitheir indeed have we now sent you many things,
        which we should &amp; would, for want of money. But persons, more then
        inough, (though not all we should,) for people come flying in upon us,
        but monys come creeping in to us. Some few of your old freinds are come,
        as, &amp;c. So they come droping to you, and by degrees, I hope ere long
        you shall enjoye them all. And because people press so hard upon us to
        goe, and often shuch as are none of y<sup>e</sup> fitest, I pray you
        write ernestly to y<sup>e</sup> Treasurer and directe what persons
        should be sente. It greeveth me to see so weake a company sent you, and
        yet had I not been hear they had been weaker. You must still call upon
        the company hear to see y<sup>t</sup> honest men be sente you, and
        threaten to send them back if any other come, &amp;c. We are not any way
        so much in danger, as by corrupte an noughty persons. Shuch, and shuch,
        came without my consente; but y<sup>e</sup> importunitie of their
        freinds got promise of our Treasurer in my absence. Neither is ther need

        that we will deal fairly, and squarly answer your expectations to the

      <p>
        We have sente you diverse fisher men, with salte, &amp;c. Diverse other

      These passengers, when they saw their low &amp; poore condition a shore,
      were much danted and dismayed, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175"
      id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>and according to their diverse humores were
      diversly affected; some wished them selves in England againe; others fell
      a weeping, fancying their own miserie in what y<sup>ey</sup> saw now in
      others; other some pitying the distress they saw their freinds had been
      long in, and still were under; in a word, all were full of sadnes. Only
      some of their old freinds rejoysed to see them, and y<sup>t</sup> it was
      no worse with them, for they could not expecte it should be better, and
      now hoped they should injoye better days togeather. And truly it was [103]
      no marvell they should be thus affected, for they were in a very low
      condition, many were ragged in aparell, &amp; some litle beter then halfe
      naked; though some y<sup>t</sup> were well stord before, were well enough
      in this regard. But for food they were all alike, save some y<sup>t</sup>
      had got a few pease of y<sup>e</sup> ship y<sup>t</sup> was last hear. The
      best dish they could presente their freinds with was a lobster, or a peece
      of fish, without bread or any thing els but a cupp of fair spring water.
      And y<sup>e</sup> long continuance of this diate, and their labours
      abroad, had something abated y<sup>e</sup> freshnes of their former
      complexion. But God gave them health and strength in a good measure; and
      shewed them by experience y<sup>e</sup> truth of y<sup>t</sup> word, Deut.
      8. 3. <i>Y<sup>t</sup> man liveth not by bread only, but by every word y<sup>t</sup>
      proceedeth out of y<sup>e</sup> mouth of y<sup>e</sup> Lord doth a man
      live.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      When I think how sadly y<sup>e</sup> scripture speaks of the famine in
      Jaakobs time, when he said to his sonns, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>Goe buy us food, that we may
      live and not dye. Gen. 42. 2. and 43. 1, that the famine was great, or
      heavie in the land; and yet they had such great herds, and store of catle
      of sundrie kinds, which, besids flesh, must needs produse other food, as
      milke, butter &amp; cheese, &amp;c., and yet it was counted a sore
      affliction; theirs hear must needs be very great, therfore, who not only
      wanted the staffe of bread, but all these things, and had no Egipte to goe
      too. But God fedd them out of y<sup>e</sup> sea for y<sup>e</sup> most
      parte, so wonderfull is his providence over his in all ages; for his
      mercie endureth for ever.

    <p>
      On y<sup>e</sup> other hand the old planters were affraid that their
      corne, when it was ripe, should be imparted to y<sup>e</sup> new-com&#773;ers,
      whose provissions w<sup>ch</sup> they brought with them they feared would
      fall short before y<sup>e</sup> year wente aboute (as indeed it did). They
      came to y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> and besought him that as it was
      before agreed that they should set corne for their perticuler, and
      accordingly they had taken extraordinary pains ther aboute, that they
      might freely injoye the same, and they would not have a bitte of y<sup>e</sup>
      victails now come, but waite till harvest for their owne, and let y<sup>e</sup>
      new-com&#773;ers injoye what they had brought; they would have none of it,
      excepte they could purchase any of it of them by bargaine or exchainge.
      Their requeste was granted them, for it gave both sides good contente; for
      y<sup>e</sup> new-com&#773;ers were as much afraid that y<sup>e</sup>
      hungrie <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>planters
      would have eat up y<sup>e</sup> provissions brought, and they should have
      fallen into y<sup>e</sup> like condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ship was in a shorte time laden with clapbord, by y<sup>e</sup> help
      of many hands. Also they sente in her all y<sup>e</sup> beaver and other
      furrs they had, &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow was sent over with her, to
      informe of all things, and procure such things as were thought needfull
      for their presente condition. By this time harvest was come, and in stead
      of famine, now God gave them plentie, and y<sup>e</sup> face of things was
      changed, to y<sup>e</sup> rejoysing of y<sup>e</sup> harts of many, for
      which they blessed God. And y<sup>e</sup> effect of their particuler
      planting was well seene, for all had, one way &amp; other, pretty well to
      bring y<sup>e</sup> year aboute, and some of y<sup>e</sup> abler sorte and
      more [104] industrious had to spare, and sell to others, so as any
      generall wante or famine hath not been amongst them since to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those that come on their perticuler looked for greater matters then they
      found or could attaine unto, aboute building great houses, and such
      pleasant situations for them, as them selves had fancied; as if they would
      be great men &amp; rich, all of a sudaine; but they proved castls in y<sup>e</sup>
      aire. These were y<sup>e</sup> conditions agreed on betweene y<sup>e</sup>
      colony and them.

    <p>
      First, that y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>, in y<sup>e</sup> name and with
      y<sup>e</sup> consente of y<sup>e</sup> company, doth in all love and
      frendship receive and imbrace them; and is to allote them competente
      places for habitations within y<sup>e</sup> towne. And promiseth <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>to shew
      them all such other curtesies as shall be reasonable for them to desire,
      or us to performe.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That they, on their parts, be subjecte to all such laws &amp; orders as
      are already made, or hear after shall be, for y<sup>e</sup> publick good.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. That they be freed and exempte from y<sup>e</sup> generall imployments
      of the said company, (which their presente condition of comunitie
      requireth,) excepte commune defence, &amp; such other imployments as tend
      to y<sup>e</sup> perpetuall good of y<sup>e</sup> collony.
    </p>
    <p>
      4<sup>ly</sup>. Towards y<sup>e</sup> maintenance of Gov&#771;<sup>rt</sup>,
      &amp; publick officers of y<sup>e</sup> said collony, every male above y<sup>e</sup>
      age of 16. years shall pay a bushell of Indean wheat, or y<sup>e</sup>
      worth of it, into y<sup>e</sup> commone store.
    </p>
    <p>
      5<sup>ly</sup>. That (according to y<sup>e</sup> agreemente y<sup>e</sup>
      marchants made with y<sup>m</sup> before they came) they are to be wholy
      debared from all trade with the Indeans for all sorts of furrs, and such
      like commodities, till y<sup>e</sup> time of y<sup>e</sup> comunallitie be
      ended.

      About y<sup>e</sup> midle of September arrived Captaine Robart Gorges in y<sup>e</sup>
      Bay of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, with sundrie passengers and families,
      intending ther to begine a plantation; and pitched upon y<sup>e</sup>
      place M<sup>r</sup>. Weston's people had forsaken. He had a com&#773;ission
      from y<sup>e</sup> Counsell of New-England, to be generall Gove<sup>r</sup>
      of y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie, and they appoynted for his counsell &amp;
      assistance, Captaine Francis West, y<sup>e</sup> aforesaid admirall,
      Christopher Levite, Esquire, and y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> of Plimoth
      for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup>
      time beeing, etc. Allso, they gave him authoritie to chuse such other as
      he should find fit. Allso, they gave (by their com&#773;ission) full power
      to him and his assistants, or any 3. of them, wherof him selfe was allway
      to be one, to doe and execute what to them should seeme good, in all
      cases, Capitall, Criminall, and Civill, etc., with diverce other
      instructions. Of which, and his comission, it pleased him to suffer y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> hear to take a coppy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave them notice of his arivall by letter, but before they could visite
      him he went to y<sup>e</sup> eastward with y<sup>e</sup> ship he came in;
      but a storme arising, (and they wanting a good pilot to harbor them in
      those parts,) they bore up for this harbor. He and his men were hear
      kindly entertained; he stayed hear 14. days. In y<sup>e</sup> mean time
      came in M<sup>r</sup>. Weston with his small ship, which he had now
      recovered. [105<a name="FNanchor_BE_57" id="FNanchor_BE_57"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_BE_57" class="fnanchor">[BE]</a>] Captaine Gorges tooke
      hold of y<sup>e</sup> opportunitie, and acquainted y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>

      meete with M<sup>r</sup>. Weston, and call him to accounte for some abuses
      he had to lay to his charge. Wherupon he called him before him, and some
      other of his assistants, with y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> of this place;
      and charged him, first, with y<sup>e</sup> ille carriage of his men at y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachusets; by which means the peace of y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie was
      disturbed, and him selfe and the people which he had brought over to
      plante in that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>bay
      were therby much prejudised. To this M<sup>r</sup>. Weston easily
      answered, that what was that way done, was in his absence, and might have
      befalen any man; he left them sufficently provided, and conceived they
      would have been well governed; and for any errour com&#773;itted he had
      sufficiently smarted. This particuler was passed by. A 2<sup>d</sup>. was,
      for an abuse done to his father, S<sup>r</sup>. Ferdenando Gorges, and to
      y<sup>e</sup> State. The thing was this; he used him &amp; others of y<sup>e</sup>
      Counsell of New-England, to procure him a licence for y<sup>e</sup>
      transporting of many peeces of great ordnance for New-England, pretending
      great fortification hear in y<sup>e</sup> countrie, &amp; I know not what
      shipping. The which when he had obtained, he went and sould them beyond
      seas for his private profite; for which (he said) y<sup>e</sup> State was
      much offended, and his father suffered a shrowd check, and he had order to
      apprehend him for it. M<sup>r</sup>. Weston excused it as well as he
      could, but could not deney it; it being one maine thing (as was said) for
      which he with-drew himself. But after many passages, by y<sup>e</sup>
      mediation of y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> and some other freinds hear, he
      was inclined to gentlnes (though he aprehended y<sup>e</sup> abuse of his
      father deeply); which, when M<sup>r</sup>. Weston saw, he grew more
      presumptuous, and gave such provocking &amp; cutting speches, as made him
      rise up in great indignation &amp; distemper, and vowed y<sup>t</sup> he
      would either curb him, or send him home for England. At which M<sup>r</sup>.
      Weston was something danted, and came <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>privatly to y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> hear, to know whether they would suffer Captaine Gorges to
      apprehend him. He was tould they could not hinder him, but much blamed
      him, y<sup>t</sup> after they had pacified things, he should thus breake
      out, by his owne folly &amp; rashnes, to bring trouble upon him selfe
      &amp; them too. He confest it was his passion, and prayd y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
      to entreat for him, and pacifie him if he could. The which at last he did,
      with much adoe; so he was called againe, and y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
      was contente to take his owne bond to be ready to make further answer,
      when either he or y<sup>e</sup> lords should send for him. And at last he
      tooke only his word, and ther was a fre&#299;dly parting on all hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after he was gone, M<sup>r</sup>. Weston in lue of thanks to y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> and his freinds hear, gave them this quib (behind their
      baks) for all their pains. That though they were but yonge justices, yet
      they wear good beggers. Thus they parted at this time, and shortly after y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> tooke his leave and went to y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets by
      land, being very thankfull for his kind entertainemente. The ship stayed
      hear, and fitted her selfe to goe for Virginia, having some passengers
      ther to deliver; and with her returned sundrie of those from hence which
      came over on their perticuler, some out of discontente and dislike of y<sup>e</sup>
      cuntrie; others by reason of a fire that broke out, and burnt y<sup>e</sup>
      houses they lived in, and all their provisions [106<a name="FNanchor_BF_58"
      id="FNanchor_BF_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_BF_58" class="fnanchor">[BF]</a>]
      so as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>they
      were necessitated therunto. This fire was occasioned by some of y<sup>e</sup>
      sea-men that were roystering in a house wher it first begane, makeing a
      great fire in very could weather, which broke out of y<sup>e</sup> chimney
      into y<sup>e</sup> thatch, and burnte downe 3. or 4. houses, and consumed
      all y<sup>e</sup> goods &amp; provissions in y<sup>m</sup>. The house in
      which it begane was right against their store-house, which they had much
      adoe to save, in which were their com&#773;one store &amp; all their
      provissions; y<sup>e</sup> which if it had been lost, y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation had been over-throwne. But through Gods mercie it was saved by
      y<sup>e</sup> great dilligence of y<sup>e</sup> people, &amp; care of the
      Gov<sup>r</sup> &amp; some aboute him. Some would have had y<sup>e</sup>
      goods throwne out; but if they had, ther would much have been stolne by
      the rude company y<sup>t</sup> belonged to these 2. ships, which were
      allmost all ashore. But a trusty company was plased within, as well as
      those that with wet-cloaths &amp; other means kept of y<sup>e</sup> fire
      without, that if necessitie required they might have them out with all
      speed. For y<sup>ey</sup> suspected some malicious dealling, if not plaine
      treacherie, and whether it was only suspition or no, God knows; but this
      is certaine, that when y<sup>e</sup> tumulte was greatest, ther was a
      voyce heard (but from whom it was not knowne) that bid them looke well
      aboute them, for all were not freinds y<sup>t</sup> were near them. And
      shortly after, when the vemencie of y<sup>e</sup> fire was over, smoke was
      seen to arise within a shed y<sup>t</sup> was joynd to y<sup>e</sup> end
      of y<sup>e</sup> storehouse, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183"
      id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>which was watled up with bowes, in y<sup>e</sup>
      withered leaves wherof y<sup>e</sup> fire was kindled, which some, run&#773;ing
      to quench, found a longe firebrand of an ell longe, lying under y<sup>e</sup>
      wale on y<sup>e</sup> inside, which could not possibly come their by
      cassualtie, but must be laid ther by some hand, in y<sup>e</sup> judgmente
      of all that saw it. But God kept them from this deanger, what ever was
      intended.

      Shortly after Captaine Gorges, y<sup>e</sup> generall Gov<sup>r</sup>, was
      come home to y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, he sends a warrante to arrest M<sup>r</sup>.
      Weston &amp; his ship, and sends a m<sup>r</sup>. to bring her away
      thither, and one Captain Hanson (that belonged to him) to conducte him
      along. The Gov<sup>r</sup> &amp; others hear were very sory to see him
      take this course, and tooke exception at y<sup>e</sup> warrante, as not
      legall nor sufficiente; and withall write to him to disswade him from this
      course, shewing him y<sup>t</sup> he would but entangle and burthen him
      selfe in doing this; for he could not doe M<sup>r</sup>. Weston a better
      turne, (as things stood with him); for he had a great many men that
      belonged to him in this barke, and was deeply ingaged to them for wages,
      and was in a man&#773;er out of victails (<i>and now winter</i>); all
      which would light upon him, if he did arrest his barke. In y<sup>e</sup>
      mean time M<sup>r</sup>. Weston had notice to shift for him selfe; but it
      was conceived he either knew not whither to goe, or how to mend him selfe,
      but was rather glad of y<sup>e</sup> occasion, and so stirred not. But y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> would not be perswaded, but <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>[107] sent a very formall
      warrente under his hand &amp; seall, with strict charge as they would
      answere it to y<sup>e</sup> state; he also write that he had better
      considered of things since he was hear, and he could not answer it to let
      him goe so; besids other things that were come to his knowledg since,
      which he must answer too. So he was suffered to proceede, but he found in
      the end that to be true that was tould him; for when an inventorie was
      taken of what was in y<sup>e</sup> ship, ther was not vitailes found for
      above 14. days, at a pare allowance, and not much else of any great worth,
      &amp; the men did so crie out of him for wages and diate, in y<sup>e</sup>
      mean time, as made him soone weary. So as in conclusion it turned to his
      loss, and y<sup>e</sup> expence of his owne provissions; and <i>towards
      the spring</i> they came to agreement, (after they had bene to y<sup>e</sup>
      eastward,) and y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> restord him his vessell
      againe, and made him satisfaction, in bisket, meal, and such like
      provissions, for what he had made use of that was his, or what his men had
      any way wasted or consumed. So M<sup>r</sup>. Weston came hither againe,
      and afterward shaped his course for Virginie, &amp; so for present I shall
      leave him.<a name="FNanchor_BG_59" id="FNanchor_BG_59"></a><a

    <p>
      The Gov<sup>r</sup> and some y<sup>t</sup> depended upon him returned for
      England, haveing scarcly saluted y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie in his Govermente,
      not finding the state of things hear to <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>answer his quallitie &amp;
      condition. The peopl dispersed them selves, some went for England, others
      for Virginia, some few remained, and were helped with supplies from hence.
      The Gov<sup>r</sup> brought over a minister with him, one M<sup>r</sup>.
      Morell, who, about a year after y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> returned,
      tooke shipping from hence. He had I know not what power and authority of
      superintendancie over other churches granted him, and sundrie instructions
      for that end; but he never shewed it, or made any use of it; (it should
      seeme he saw it was in vaine;) he only speake of it to some hear at his
      going away. This was in effect y<sup>e</sup> end of a 2. plantation in
      that place. Ther were allso this year some scatering beginings made in
      other places, as at Paskataway, by M<sup>r</sup>. David Thomson, at
      Monhigen, and some other places by sundrie others.

      It rests now y<sup>t</sup> I speake a word aboute y<sup>e</sup> pin&#773;ass
      spoken of before, which was sent by y<sup>e</sup> adventurers to be
      imployed in y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie. She was a fine vessell, and bravely set
      out,<a name="FNanchor_BH_60" id="FNanchor_BH_60"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_BH_60" class="fnanchor">[BH]</a> and I fear y<sup>e</sup>
      adventurers did over pride them selves in her, for she had ill success.
      How ever, they erred grosly in tow things aboute her; first, though she
      had a sufficiente maister, yet she was rudly man&#773;ed, and all her men
      were upon shars, and none was to have any wages but y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>.
      2<sup>ly</sup>, wheras they mainly lookt at trade, they had sent nothing
      of any value to trade with. When the men came hear, and mette with <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>ill
      counsell from M<sup>r</sup>. Weston &amp; his crue, with others of y<sup>e</sup>
      same stampe, neither m<sup>r</sup>. nor Gov<sup>r</sup> could scarce rule
      [108] them, for they exclaimed that they were abused &amp; deceived, for
      they were tould they should goe for a man of warr, and take I know not
      whom, French &amp; Spaniards, &amp;c. They would neither trade nor fish,
      excepte they had wages; in fine, they would obey no com&#773;and of y<sup>e</sup>
      maisters; so it was apprehended they would either rune away with y<sup>e</sup>
      vessell, or get away w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> ships, and leave her; so
      as M<sup>r</sup>. Peirce &amp; others of their freinds perswaded the Gov<sup>r</sup>
      to chaing their condition, and give them wages; which was accordingly
      done. And she was sente about y<sup>e</sup> Cape to y<sup>e</sup>
      Narigansets to trade, but they made but a poore vioage of it. Some corne
      and beaver they got, but y<sup>e</sup> Dutch used to furnish them with
      cloath &amp; better com&#773;odities, they haveing only a few beads &amp;
      knives, which were not ther much esteemed. Allso, in her returne home, at
      y<sup>e</sup> very entrance into ther owne harbore, she had like to have
      been cast away in a storme, and was forced to cut her maine mast by y<sup>e</sup>
      bord, to save herselfe from driving on y<sup>e</sup> flats that lye
      without, caled Browns Ilands, the force of y<sup>e</sup> wind being so
      great as made her anchors give way and she drive right upon them; but her
      mast &amp; takling being gone, they held her till y<sup>e</sup> wind
      shifted. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>

      The time of new election of ther officers for this year being come, and<a

      class="fnanchor">[BI]</a> y<sup>e</sup> number of their people increased,
      and their troubls and occasions therwith, the Gov<sup>r</sup> desired them
      to chainge y<sup>e</sup> persons, as well as renew y<sup>e</sup> election;
      and also to adde more Assistans to y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> for help
      &amp; counsell, and y<sup>e</sup> better carrying on of affairs. Showing
      that it was necessarie it should be so. If it was any honour or benefite,
      it was fitte others should be made pertakers of it; if it was a burthen,
      (as doubtles it was,) it was but equall others should help to bear it; and
      y<sup>t</sup> this was y<sup>e</sup> end of An&#773;uall Elections. The
      issue was, that as before ther was but one Assistante, they now chose 5.
      giving the Gov<sup>r</sup> a duble voyce; and aftwards they increased them
      to 7. which course hath continued to this day.

      They having with some truble &amp; charge new-masted and rigged their
      pinass, in y<sup>e</sup> begining of March they sent her well vitaled to
      the eastward on fishing. She arrived safly at a place near Damarins cove,
      and was there well harbored in a place wher ships used to ride, ther being
      also some ships allready arived out of England. But shortly after ther
      [109] arose such a violent &amp; extraordinarie storme, as y<sup>e</sup>
      seas broak over such places in y<sup>e</sup> harbor as was never seene
      before, and drive her against great roks, which beat such <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>a hole in
      her bulke, as a horse and carte might have gone in, and after drive her
      into deep-water, wher she lay sunke. The m<sup>r</sup>. was drowned, the
      rest of y<sup>e</sup> men, all save one, saved their lives, with much a
      doe; all her provision, salt, and what els was in her, was lost. And here
      I must leave her to lye till afterward.

    <p>
      Some of those that still remained hear on their perticuler, begane
      privatly to nurish a faction, and being privie to a strong faction that
      was among y<sup>e</sup> adventurers in England, on whom sundry of them did
      depend, by their private whispering they drew some of the weaker sorte of
      y<sup>e</sup> company to their side, and so filld them with discontente,
      as nothing would satisfie them excepte they might be suffered to be in
      their perticuler allso; and made great offers, so they might be freed from
      y<sup>e</sup> generall. The Gov<sup>r</sup> consulting with y<sup>e</sup>
      ablest of y<sup>e</sup> generall body what was best to be done hear in, it
      was resolved to permitte them so to doe, upon equall conditions. The
      conditions were the same in effect with y<sup>e</sup> former before
      related. Only some more added, as that they should be bound here to
      remaine till y<sup>e</sup> generall partnership was ended. And also that
      they should pay into y<sup>e</sup> store, y<sup>e</sup> on halfe of all
      such goods and comodities as they should any waise raise above their food,
      in consideration of what charg had been layed out for them, with some such
      like things. This liberty granted, soone stopt this gape, for ther was but
      a few that undertooke this course when it <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>came too; and they were as
      sone weary of it. For the other had perswaded them, &amp; M<sup>r</sup>.
      Weston togeather, that ther would never come more supply to y<sup>e</sup>
      generall body; but y<sup>e</sup> perticulers had such freinds as would
      carry all, and doe for them I know not what.

      Shortly after, M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow came over, and brought a prety good
      supply, and the ship came on fishing, a thing fatall to this plantation.
      He brought 3. heifers &amp; a bull, the first begining of any catle of
      that kind in y<sup>e</sup> land, with some cloathing &amp; other
      necessaries, as will further appear; but withall y<sup>e</sup> reporte of

      espetially against y<sup>e</sup> coming of y<sup>e</sup> rest from Leyden,
      and with what difficulty this supply was procured, and how, by their
      strong &amp; long opposision, bussines was so retarded as not only they
      were now falne too late for y<sup>e</sup> fishing season, but the best men
      were taken up of y<sup>e</sup> fishermen in the west countrie, and he was
      forct to take such a m<sup>r</sup>. &amp; company for that imployment as

        Charitie, with men &amp; necessaries, both for the plantation and the
        fishing, though accomplished with very great difficulty; in regard we
        have some amongst us which undoubtedly aime more at their owne private
        ends, and the thwarting &amp; opposing of some hear, and other worthy
        instruments,<a name="FNanchor_BK_63" id="FNanchor_BK_63"></a><a

        then at the generall good and furtherance of this noble &amp; laudable
        action. Yet againe we have many other, and I hope the greatest parte,
        very honest Christian men, which I am perswaded their ends and intents
        are wholy for the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the propagation of
        his gospell, and hope of gaining those poore salvages to the knowledg of
        God. But, as we have a proverbe, One scabed sheep may marr a whole
        flock, so these malecontented persons, &amp; turbulente spirits, doe
        what in them lyeth to withdraw mens harts from you and your freinds,
        yea, even from the generall bussines; and yet under show and pretence of
        godlynes and furtherance of the plantation. Wheras the quite contrary
        doth plainly appeare; as some of the honester harted men (though of late
        of their faction) did make manifest at our late meeting. But what should
        I trouble you or my selfe with these restles opposers of all goodnes,
        and I doubte will be continuall disturbers of our frendly meetings &amp;
        love. On Thurs-day the 8. of Jan: we had a meeting aboute the artickls
        betweene you &amp; us; wher they would rejecte that, which we in our
        late leters prest you to grante, (an addition to the time of our joynt
        stock). And their reason which they would make known to us was, it
        trobled their conscience to exacte longer time of you then was agreed
        upon at the first. But that night they were so followed and crost of
        their perverse courses, as they were even wearied, and offered to sell
        their adventurs; and some were willing to buy. But I, doubting they
        would raise more scandale and false <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>reports, and so diverse
        waise doe us more hurt, by going of in such a furie, then they could or
        can by continuing adventurers amongst us, would not suffer them. But on
        y<sup>e</sup> 12. of Jan: we had another meting, but in the interime
        diverse of us had talked with most of them privatly, and had great
        combats &amp; reasoning, pro &amp; con. But at night when we mete to
        read y<sup>e</sup> generall letter, we had y<sup>e</sup> loveingest and

      <p>
        Beloved S<sup>r</sup>., &amp;c. We have now sent you, we hope, men &amp;
        means, to setle these 3. things, viz. fishing, salt making, and boat
        making; if you can bring them to pass to some perfection, your wants may
        be supplyed. I pray you bend you selfe what you can to setle these
        bussinesses. Let y<sup>e</sup> ship be fraught away as soone as you can,
        and sent to Bilbow. You must send some discreete man for factore, whom,
        once more, you must also authorise to confirme y<sup>e</sup> conditions.
        If M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow could be spared, I could wish he came <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>againe.
        This ship carpenter is thought to be the fittest man for you in the
        land, and will no doubte doe you much good. Let him have an absolute
        comand over his servants &amp; such as you put to him. Let him build you
        2. catches, a lighter, and some 6. or 7. shalops, as soone as you can.
        The salt-man is a skillfull &amp; industrious man, put some to him, that
        may quickly apprehende y<sup>e</sup> misterie of it. The preacher we
        have sent is (we hope) an honest plaine man, though none of y<sup>e</sup>
        most eminente and rare. Aboute chusing him into office use your owne
        liberty &amp; discretion; he knows he is no officer amongst you, though
        perhaps custome &amp; universalitie may make him forget him selfe. M<sup>r</sup>.
        Winslow &amp; my selfe gave way to his going, to give contente to some
        hear, and we see no hurt in it, but only his great charge of children.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have tooke a patente for Cap Anne, &amp;c. I am sory ther is no more
        discretion used by some in their leters hither.<a name="FNanchor_BN_66"
        id="FNanchor_BN_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_BN_66" class="fnanchor">[BN]</a>
        Some say you are starved in body &amp; soule; others, y<sup>t</sup> you
        eate piggs &amp; doggs, that dye alone; others, that y<sup>e</sup>
        things hear spoaken of, y<sup>e</sup> goodnes of y<sup>e</sup> cuntry,
        are gross and palpable lyes; that ther is scarce a foule to be seene, or
        a fish to be taken, and many such like. I would such discontented men
        were hear againe, for it is a miserie when y<sup>e</sup> whole state of
        a plantation shall be thus exposed to y<sup>e</sup> passionate humors of
        some discontented men. And for my selfe I shall hinder for hearafter
        some y<sup>t</sup> would goe, and have not better composed their
        affections; mean space it is all our crosses, and we must bear them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am sorie we have not sent you more and other things, but in truth we
        have rune into so much charge, to victaile y<sup>e</sup> ship, provide
        salte &amp; other fishing implements, &amp;c. as we could not provid
        other comfortable things, as buter, suger, &amp;c. I hope the returne of
        this ship, and the James, will <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193"
        id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>put us in cash againe. The Lord make you
        full of courage in this troublesome bussines, which now must be stuck
        unto, till God give us rest from our labours. Fare well in all harty
        affection.

    <p>
      With y<sup>e</sup> former letter write by M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley, there
      were sente sundrie objections concerning which he thus writeth. "These are
      the cheefe objections which they [112] that are now returned make against
      you and the countrie. I pray you consider them, and answer them by the
      first conveniencie." These objections were made by some of those that came
      over on their perticuler and were returned home, as is before mentioned,
      and were of y<sup>e</sup> same suite with those y<sup>t</sup> this other
      letter mentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall here set them downe, with y<sup>e</sup> answers then made unto
      them, and sent over at y<sup>e</sup> returne of this ship; which did so
      confound y<sup>e</sup> objecters, as some confessed their falte, and
      others deneyed what they had said, and eate their words, &amp; some others
      of them have since come over againe and heere lived to convince them
      selves sufficiently, both in their owne &amp; other mens judgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. obj. was diversitie aboute Religion. Ans: We know no such matter, for
      here was never any controversie or opposition, either publicke or private,
      (to our knowledg,) since we came.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      2. ob: Neglecte of familie duties, one y<sup>e</sup> Lords day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ans. We allow no such thing, but blame it in our selves &amp; others; and
      they that thus reporte it, should have shewed their Christian love the
      more if they had in love tould y<sup>e</sup> offenders of it, rather then
      thus to reproach them behind their baks. But (to say no more) we wish them
      selves had given better example.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. ob: Wante of both the sacrements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ans. The more is our greefe, that our pastor is kept from us, by whom we
      might injoye them; for we used to have the Lords Supper every Saboth, and
      baptisme as often as ther was occasion of children to baptise.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. ob: Children not catechised nor taught to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ans: Neither is true; for diverse take pains with their owne as they can;
      indeede, we have no com&#773;one schoole for want of a fitt person, or
      hithertoo means to maintaine one; though we desire now to begine.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. ob: Many of y<sup>e</sup> perticuler members of y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation will not work for y<sup>e</sup> generall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ans: This allso is not wholy true; for though some doe it not willingly,
      &amp; other not honestly, yet all doe it; and he that doth worst gets his
      owne foode &amp; something besids. But we will not excuse them, but labour
      to reforme them y<sup>e</sup> best we cane, or else to quitte y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. ob: The water is not wholsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ans: If they mean, not so wholsome as y<sup>e</sup> good <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>beere and
      wine in London, (which they so dearly love,) we will not dispute with
      them; but els, for water, it is as good as any in the world, (for ought we
      knowe,) and it is wholsome enough to us that can be contente therwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. ob: The ground is barren and doth bear no grasse.
    </p>
    <p>
      [113] Ans: It is hear (as in all places) some better &amp; some worse; and
      if they well consider their words, in England they shall not find such
      grasse in them, as in their feelds &amp; meadows. The catle find grasse,
      for they are as fatt as need be; we wish we had but one for every hundred
      that hear is grase to keep. Indeed, this objection, as some other, are
      ridiculous to all here which see and know y<sup>e</sup> contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. ob: The fish will not take salt to keepe sweete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ans: This is as true as that which was written, that ther is scarce a
      foule to be seene or a fish to be taken. Things likly to be true in a
      cuntrie wher so many sayle of ships come yearly a fishing; they might as
      well say, there can no aile or beere in London be kept from sowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. ob: Many of them are theevish and steale on from an other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ans: Would London had been free from that crime, then we should not have
      been trobled with these here; it is well knowne sundrie have smarted well
      for it, and so are y<sup>e</sup> rest like to doe, if they be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      10. ob: The countrie is anoyed with foxes and woules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ans: So are many other good cuntries too; but poyson, traps, and other
      such means will help to destroy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. ob: The Dutch are planted nere Hudsons Bay, and are likely to
      overthrow the trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ans: They will come and plante in these parts, also, if we and others doe
      not, but goe home and leave it to them. We rather commend them, then
      condemne them for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. ob: The people are much anoyed with muskeetoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ans: They are too delicate and unfitte to begine new-plantations and
      collonies, that cannot enduer the biting of a muskeeto; we would wish such
      to keepe at home till at least they be muskeeto proofe. Yet this place is
      as free as any, and experience teacheth that y<sup>e</sup> more y<sup>e</sup>
      land is tild, and y<sup>e</sup> woods cut downe, the fewer ther will be,
      and in the end scarse any at all.

        My loving &amp; much beloved friend, whom God hath hithertoo preserved,
        preserve and keepe you still to his glorie, and y<sup>e</sup> good of
        many; that his blessing may make your godly and wise endeavours

        Our love &amp; care to and for you, is mutuall, though our hopes of
        coming [114] unto you be small, and weaker then ever. But of this at
        large in Mr. Brewsters letter, with whom you, and he with you, mutualy,

        Concerning y<sup>e</sup> killing of those poor Indeans, of which we
        heard at first by reporte, and since by more certaine relation, oh! how
        happy a thing had it been, if you had converted some, before you had
        killed any; besids, wher bloud is one begune to be shed, it is seldome
        stanched of a long time after. You will say they deserved it. I grant
        it; but upon what provocations and invitments by those heathenish
        Christians?<a name="FNanchor_BO_67" id="FNanchor_BO_67"></a><a
        href="#Footnote_BO_67" class="fnanchor">[BO]</a> Besids, you, being no
        magistrats over them, were to consider, not what they deserved, but what
        you were by necessitie constrained to inflicte. Necessitie of this,
        espetially of killing so many, (and many more, it seems, they would, if
        they could,) I see not. Methinks on or tow principals should have been
        full enough, according to that approved rule, The punishmente to a few,
        and y<sup>e</sup> fear to many. Upon this occasion let me be bould to
        exhorte you seriouly to consider of y<sup>e</sup> dispossition of your
        Captaine, whom I love, and am perswaded y<sup>e</sup> Lord in great
        mercie and for much good hath sent you him, if you use him aright. He is
        a man humble and meek amongst you, and towards all <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>in ordinarie course. But
        now if this be meerly from an humane spirite, ther is cause to fear that
        by occasion, espetially of provocation, ther may be wanting y<sup>t</sup>
        tendernes of y<sup>e</sup> life of man (made after Gods image) which is
        meete. It is also a thing more glorious in mens eyes, then pleasing in
        Gods, or conveniente for Christians, to be a terrour to poore barbarous
        people; and indeed I am afraid least, by these occasions, others should
        be drawne to affecte a kind of rufling course in the world. I doubt not
        but you will take in good part these things which I write, and as ther
        is cause make use of them. It were to us more comfortable and
        convenient, that we comunicated our mutuall helps in presence, but
        seeing that canot be done, we shall always long after you, and love you,
        and waite Gods apoynted time. The adventurers it seems have neither

        should tr&#257;sporte us, neither doe I looke for any further help from

        Loving and dear friend and brother: That which I most desired of God in
        regard of you, namly, y<sup>e</sup> continuance of your life and health,
        and the safe coming of these sent unto <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>you, that I most gladly
        hear of, and praise God for the same. And I hope M<sup>rs</sup>.
        Brewsters weake and decayed state of body will have some reparing by the
        coming of her daughters, and the provissions in this and former ships, I
        hear is made for you; which maks us with more patience bear our
        languishing state, and y<sup>e</sup> deferring of our desired tr&#257;sportation;
        w<sup>ch</sup> I call desired, rather than hoped for, whatsoever you are
        borne in hand by any others. For first, ther is no hope at all, that I
        know, or can conceive of, of any new stock to be raised for that end; so
        that all must depend [115] upon returns from you, in which are so many
        uncertainties, as that nothing with any certaintie can thence be
        concluded. Besids, howsoever for y<sup>e</sup> presente the adventurers
        aledg nothing but want of money, which is an invincible difculty, yet if
        that be taken away by you, others without doubte will be found. For the
        beter clearing of this, we must dispose y<sup>e</sup> adventurers into
        3. parts; and of them some 5. or 6. (as I conceive) are absolutly bent
        for us, above any others. Other 5. or 6. are our bitter professed
        adversaries. The rest, being the body, I conceive to be honestly minded,
        &amp; loveingly also towards us; yet such as have others (namly y<sup>e</sup>
        forward preachers) nerer unto them, then us, and whose course so farr as
        ther is any differance, they would rather advance then ours. Now what a
        hanck these men have over y<sup>e</sup> professors, you know. And I
        perswade my selfe, that for me, they of all others are unwilling I
        should be transported, espetially such of them as have an eye that way
        them selves; as thinking if I come ther, ther market will be mard in
        many regards. And for these adversaries, if they have but halfe y<sup>e</sup>
        witte to their malice, they will stope my course when they see it
        intended, for which this delaying serveth them very opportunly. And as
        one restie jade can hinder, by hanging back, more then two or 3. can (or
        will at least, if they be not very free) draw forward, <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>so will
        it be in this case. A notable<a name="FNanchor_BP_68" id="FNanchor_BP_68"></a><a
        href="#Footnote_BP_68" class="fnanchor">[BP]</a> experimente of this,
        they gave in your messengers presence, constraining y<sup>e</sup>
        company to promise that none of the money now gathered should be
        expended or imployed to y<sup>e</sup> help of any of us towards you. Now
        touching y<sup>e</sup> question propounded by you, I judg it not lawfull
        for you, being a ruling Elder, as Rom. 12. 7. 8. &amp; 1. Tim. 5. 17.
        opposed to the Elders that teach &amp; exhorte and labore in y<sup>e</sup>
        word and doctrine, to which y<sup>e</sup> sacrements are an&#773;exed,
        to administer them, nor convenient if it were lawfull. Whether any
        larned man will come unto you or not, I know not; if any doe, you must
        <i>Consili&#363; capere in arena</i>. Be you most hartily saluted, &amp;
        you<sup>r</sup> wife with you, both from me &amp; mine. Your God &amp;
        ours, and y<sup>e</sup> God of all his, bring us together if it be his
        will, and keep us in the mean while, and allways to his glory, and make

      These things premised, I shall now prosecute y<sup>e</sup> procedings and
      afairs here. And before I come to other things I must speak a word of
      their planting this year; they having found y<sup>e</sup> benifite of
      their last years harvest, and setting corne for their particuler, having
      therby with a great deale of patience overcome hunger &amp; famine. Which
      maks me remember a saing of Senecas, <i>Epis: 123</i>. <i>That a great
      parte of libertie is a well governed belly, and to be patiente in all
      wants.</i> They begane now highly to prise corne as <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>more pretious then silver,
      and those that had some to spare begane to trade one with another for
      smale things, by y<sup>e</sup> quarte, potle, &amp; peck, &amp;c.; for
      money they had none, and if any had, corne was prefered before it. That
      they might therfore encrease their tillage to better advantage, they made
      suite [116] to the Gov<sup>r</sup> to have some portion of land given them
      for continuance, and not by yearly lotte, for by that means, that which y<sup>e</sup>
      more industrious had brought into good culture (by much pains) one year,
      came to leave it y<sup>e</sup> nexte, and often another might injoye it;
      so as the dressing of their lands were the more sleighted over, &amp; to
      lese profite. Which being well considered, their request was granted. And
      to every person was given only one acrre of land, to them &amp; theirs, as
      nere y<sup>e</sup> towne as might be, and they had no more till y<sup>e</sup>
      7. years were expired. The reason was, that they might be kept close
      together both for more saftie and defence, and y<sup>e</sup> better
      improvement of y<sup>e</sup> generall imployments. Which condition of
      theirs did make me often thinke, of what I had read in Plinie<a
      name="FNanchor_BQ_69" id="FNanchor_BQ_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_BQ_69"
      class="fnanchor">[BQ]</a> of y<sup>e</sup> Romans first beginings in
      Romulus time. <i>How every man contented him selfe with 2. Acres of land,
      and had no more assigned them. And chap. 3. It was thought a great reward,
      to receive at y<sup>e</sup> hands of y<sup>e</sup> people of Rome a pinte
      of corne. And long after, the greatest presente given to a Captaine y<sup>t</sup>
      had gotte a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>victory
      over their enemise, was as much ground as they could till in one day. And
      he was not counted a good, but a dangerous man, that would not contente
      him selfe with 7. Acres of land. As also how they did pound their corne in
      morters</i>, as these people were forcte to doe many years before they
      could get a mille.

    <p>
      The ship which brought this supply, was speedily discharged, and with her
      m<sup>r</sup> &amp; company sente to Cap-Anne (of which place they had
      gott a patente, as before is shewed) on fishing, and because the season
      was so farr spente some of y<sup>e</sup> planters were sent to help to
      build their stage, to their owne hinderance. But partly by y<sup>e</sup>
      latenes of y<sup>e</sup> year, and more espetialy by y<sup>e</sup> basnes
      of y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>, one Baker, they made a poore viage of it.
      He proved a very drunken beast, and did nothing (in a maner) but drink,
      &amp; gusle, and consume away y<sup>e</sup> time &amp; his victails; and
      most of his company followed his example; and though M<sup>r</sup>.
      William Peirce was to over see the busines, &amp; to be m<sup>r</sup>. of
      y<sup>e</sup> ship home, yet he could doe no good amongst them, so as y<sup>e</sup>
      loss was great, and would have bene more to them, but that they kept one a
      trading ther, which in those times got some store of skins, which was some
      help unto them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship-carpenter that was sent them, was an honest and very industrious
      man, and followed his labour very dilligently, and made all that were
      imployed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>with
      him doe y<sup>e</sup> like; he quickly builte them 2. very good &amp;
      strong shalops (which after did them greate service), and a great and
      strong lighter, and had hewne timber for 2. catches; but that was lost,
      for he fell into a feaver in y<sup>e</sup> hote season of the year, and
      though he had the best means y<sup>e</sup> place could aforde, yet he
      dyed; of whom they had a very [117] great loss, and were very sorie for
      his death. But he whom they sent to make salte was an ignorante, foolish,
      self-willd fellow; he bore them in hand he could doe great matters in
      making salt-works, so he was sente to seeke out fitte ground for his
      purpose; and after some serch he tould y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> that
      he had found a sufficente place, with a good botome to hold water, and
      otherwise very conveniente, which he doubted not but in a short time to
      bring to good perfection, and to yeeld them great profite; but he must
      have 8. or ten men to be constantly imployed. He was wisht to be sure that
      y<sup>e</sup> ground was good, and other things answerable, and y<sup>t</sup>
      he could bring it to perfection; otherwise he would bring upon them a
      great charge by imploying him selfe and so many men. But he was, after
      some triall, so confidente, as he caused them to send carpenters to rear a
      great frame for a large house, to receive y<sup>e</sup> salte &amp; such
      other uses. But in y<sup>e</sup> end all proved vaine. Then he layed fault
      of y<sup>e</sup> ground, in which he was deceived; but if he might have
      the lighter to cary clay, he was sure then he could doe it. Now though
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> &amp; some other foresaw that this would come to litle,
      yet they had so many malignant spirits amongst them, that would have laid
      it upon them, in their letters of complainte to the adventurers, as to be
      their falte y<sup>t</sup> would not suffer him to goe on to bring his work
      to perfection; for as he by his bould confidence &amp; large promises
      deceived them in England that sente him, so he had wound him selfe in to
      these mens high esteeme hear, so as they were faine to let him goe on till
      all men saw his vanity. For he could not doe any thing but boyle salt in
      pans, &amp; yet would make them y<sup>t</sup> were joynd with him beleeve
      ther was so grat a misterie in it as was not easie to be attained, and
      made them doe many unnecessary things to blind their eys, till they
      discerned his sutltie. The next yere he was sente to Cap-Anne, and y<sup>e</sup>
      pans were set up ther wher the fishing was; but before som&#773;er was
      out, he bur&#773;te the house, and the fire was so vehemente as it spoyld
      the pans, at least some of them, and this was the end of that chargable
      bussines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 3<sup>d</sup>. eminente person (which y<sup>e</sup> letters before
      mention) was y<sup>e</sup> minister which they sent over, by name M<sup>r</sup>.
      John Lyford, of whom &amp; whose doing I must be more large, though I
      shall abridg things as much as I can. When this man first came a shore, he
      saluted them with that reverence &amp; humilitie as is seldome to be seen,
      and indeed made them ashamed, he so bowed and cringed unto them, and would
      have kissed their <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>hands
      if they would have [118] suffered him;<a name="FNanchor_BR_70"
      id="FNanchor_BR_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_BR_70" class="fnanchor">[BR]</a>
      yea, he wept &amp; shed many tears, blessing God that had brought him to
      see their faces; and admiring y<sup>e</sup> things they had done in their
      wants, &amp;c. as if he had been made all of love, and y<sup>e</sup>
      humblest person in the world. And all the while (if we may judg by his
      after cariags) he was but like him mentioned in Psa: 10. 10. That
      croucheth &amp; boweth, that heaps of poore may fall by his might. Or like
      to that dissembling Ishmaell,<a name="FNanchor_BS_71" id="FNanchor_BS_71"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_BS_71" class="fnanchor">[BS]</a> who, when he had slaine
      Gedelia, went out weeping and mette them y<sup>t</sup> were coming to
      offer incence in y<sup>e</sup> house of y<sup>e</sup> Lord; saing, Come to
      Gedelia, when he ment to slay them. They gave him y<sup>e</sup> best
      entertainment y<sup>ey</sup> could, (in all simplisitie,) and a larger
      alowans of food out of y<sup>e</sup> store then any other had, and as the
      Gov<sup>r</sup> had used in all waightie affairs to consulte with their
      Elder, M<sup>r</sup>. Brewster, (togeither with his assistants,) so now he
      caled M<sup>r</sup>. Liford also to counsell with them in their waightiest
      bussineses. Ater some short time he desired to joyne himselfe a member to
      y<sup>e</sup> church hear, and was accordingly received. He made a large
      confession of his faith, and an acknowledgemente of his former disorderly
      walking, and his being intangled with many corruptions, which had been a
      burthen to his conscience, and blessed God for this opportunitie of
      freedom &amp; libertie to injoye y<sup>e</sup> ordinances of God in
      puritie among his people, with many <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>more such like expressions.
      I must hear speake a word also of M<sup>r</sup>. John Oldom, who was a
      copartner with him in his after courses. He had bene a cheefe sticler in y<sup>e</sup>
      former faction among y<sup>e</sup> perticulers, and an intelligencer to
      those in England. But now, since the coming of this ship and he saw the
      supply that came, he tooke occasion to open his minde to some of y<sup>e</sup>
      cheefe amongst them heere, and confessed he had done them wrong both by
      word &amp; deed, &amp; writing into England; but he now saw the eminente
      hand of God to be with them, and his blesing upon them, which made his
      hart smite him, neither should those in England ever use him as an
      instrumente any longer against them in any thing; he also desired former
      things might be forgotten, and that they would looke upon him as one that
      desired to close with them in all things, with such like expressions. Now
      whether this was in hipocrisie, or out of some sudden pange of conviction
      (which I rather thinke), God only knows. Upon it they shew all readynes to
      imbrace his love, and carry towards him in all frendlynes, and called him
      to counsell with them in all cheefe affairs, as y<sup>e</sup> other,
      without any distrust at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus all things seemed to goe very comfortably and smothly on amongst
      them, at which they did much rejoyce; but this lasted not [119] long, for
      both Oldom and he grew very perverse, and shewed a spirite of great
      malignancie, drawing as many into faction as <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>they could; were they never
      so vile or profane, they did nourish &amp; back them in all their doings;
      so they would but cleave to them and speak against y<sup>e</sup> church
      hear; so as ther was nothing but private meetings and whisperings amongst
      them; they feeding themselves &amp; others with what they should bring to
      pass in England by the faction of their freinds their, which brought
      others as well as them selves into a fools paradise. Yet they could not
      cary so closly but much of both their doings &amp; sayings were
      discovered, yet outwardly they still set a faire face of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      At lenght when y<sup>e</sup> ship was ready to goe, it was observed Liford
      was long in writing, &amp; sente many letters, and could not forbear to
      comunicate to his intimats such things as made them laugh in their
      sleeves, and thought he had done ther errand sufficiently. The Gov<sup>r</sup>
      and some other of his freinds knowing how things stood in England, and
      what hurt these things might doe, tooke a shalop and wente out with the
      ship a league or 2. to sea, and caled for all Lifords &amp; Oldums
      letters. Mr. William Peirce being m<sup>r</sup>. of y<sup>e</sup> ship,
      (and knew well their evill dealing both in England &amp; here,) afforded
      him all y<sup>e</sup> assistance he could. He found above 20. of Lyfords
      letters, many of them larg, and full of slanders, &amp; false accusations,
      tending not only to their prejudice, but to their ruine &amp; utter
      subversion. Most of the letters they let pas, only tooke copys of them,
      but some of y<sup>e</sup> most materiall <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>they sent true copyes of
      them, and kept y<sup>e</sup> originalls, least he should deney them, and
      that they might produce his owne hand against him. Amongst his letters
      they found y<sup>e</sup> coppyes of tow letters which he sent inclosed in
      a leter of his to M<sup>r</sup>. John Pemberton, a minster, and a great
      opposite of theirs. These 2. letters of which he tooke the coppyes were
      one of them write by a gentle-man in England to M<sup>r</sup>. Brewster
      here, the other by M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow to M<sup>r</sup>. Robinson, in
      Holand, at his coming away, as y<sup>e</sup> ship lay at Gravsend. They
      lying sealed in y<sup>e</sup> great cabin, (whilst M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow
      was bussie aboute the affairs of y<sup>e</sup> ship,) this slye marchante
      taks &amp; opens them, taks these coppys, &amp; seals them up againe; and
      not only sends the coppyes of them thus to his friend and their
      adversarie, but adds thertoo in y<sup>e</sup> margente many scurrilous and
      flouting an&#773;otations. This ship went out <i>towards ev&#773;ing</i>,
      and <i>in the night</i> y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> retur&#773;ed. They
      were somwaht blanke at it, but after some weeks, when they heard nothing,
      they then were as briske as ever, thinking nothing had been knowne, but
      all was gone currente, and that the Gov<sup>r</sup> went but to dispatch
      his owne letters. The reason why the Gov<sup>r</sup> &amp; rest concealed
      these things the longer, was to let things ripen, that they [120] might y<sup>e</sup>
      better discover their intents and see who were their adherents. And y<sup>e</sup>
      rather because amongst y<sup>e</sup> rest they found a letter of one of
      their confederats, in w<sup>ch</sup> was writen that M<sup>r</sup>. Oldame
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>&amp;
      M<sup>r</sup>. Lyford intended a reformation in church and commone wealth;
      and, as soone as the ship was gone, they intended to joyne togeather, and
      have the sacrements, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Oldame, few of his leters were found, (for he was so bad a scribe as
      his hand was scarce legible,) yet he was as deepe in y<sup>e</sup>
      mischeefe as the other. And thinking they were now strong enough, they
      begane to pick quarells at every thing. Oldame being called to watch
      (according to order) refused to come, fell out with y<sup>e</sup> Capten,
      caled him raskell, and beggerly raskell, and resisted him, drew his knife
      at him; though he offered him no wrong, nor gave him no ille termes, but
      with all fairnes required him to doe his duty. The Gov<sup>r</sup>,
      hearing y<sup>e</sup> tumulte, sent to quiet it, but he ramped more like a
      furious beast then a man, and cald them all treatours, and rebells, and
      other such foule language as I am ashamed to remember; but after he was
      clapt up a while, he came to him selfe, and with some slight punishmente
      was let goe upon his behaviour for further censure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to cutt things shorte, at length it grew to this esseue, that Lyford
      with his complicies, without ever speaking one word either to y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup>, Church, or Elder, withdrewe them selves &amp; set up a
      publick meeting aparte, on y<sup>e</sup> Lord's day; with sundry such
      insolente cariages, too long here to relate, begining now publikly to acte
      what privatly they had been long plotting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now thought high time (to prevent further mischeefe) to calle them
      to accounte; so y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> called a courte and sum&#773;oned
      the whol company to appeare. And then charged Lyford &amp; Oldom with such
      things as they were guilty of. But they were stiffe, &amp; stood resolutly
      upon y<sup>e</sup> deneyall of most things, and required proofe. They
      first alledged what was write to them out of England, compared with their
      doings &amp; pactises hear; that it was evident they joyned in plotting
      against them, and disturbing their peace, both in respecte of their civill
      &amp; church state, which was most injurious; for both they and all y<sup>e</sup>
      world knew they came hither to injoye y<sup>e</sup> libertie of their
      conscience and y<sup>e</sup> free use of Gods ordinances; and for y<sup>t</sup>
      end had ventured their lives and passed throwgh so much hardshipe
      hithertoo, and they and their freinds had borne the charg of these
      beginings, which was not small. And that Lyford for his parte was sent
      over on this charge, and that both he and his great family was maintained
      on y<sup>e</sup> same, and also was joyned to y<sup>e</sup> church, &amp;
      a member of them; and for him to plote against them &amp; seek their
      ruine, was most unjust &amp; perfidious. And for [121] Oldam or any other
      that came over at their owne charge, and were on ther perticuler, seeing
      they were received in curtesie by the plantation, when they came only to
      seeke shelter &amp; protection under their wings, not being able to stand
      alone, that they, (according to y<sup>e</sup> fable,) <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>like the Hedghogg whom y<sup>e</sup>
      conny in a stormy day in pittie received into her borrow, would not be
      content to take part with her, but in the end with her sharp pricks forst
      the poore conny to forsake her owne borrow; so these men with the like
      injustice indevored to doe y<sup>e</sup> same to thos that entertained
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lyford denyed that he had any thing to doe with them in England, or knew
      of their courses, and made other things as strange that he was charged
      with. Then his letters were prodused &amp; some of them read, at which he
      was struck mute. But Oldam begane to rage furiously, because they had
      intercepted and opened his letters, threatening them in very high
      language, and in a most audacious and mutinous maner stood up &amp; caled
      upon y<sup>e</sup> people, saying, My maisters, wher is your harts? now
      shew your courage, you have oft complained to me so &amp; so; now is y<sup>e</sup>
      time, if you will doe any thing, I will stand by you, &amp;c. Thinking y<sup>t</sup>
      every one (knowing his humor) that had soothed and flattered him, or other
      wise in their discontente uttered any thing unto him, would now side w<sup>th</sup>
      him in open rebellion. But he was deceived, for not a man opened his
      mouth, but all were silent, being strucken with the injustice of y<sup>e</sup>
      thing. Then y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> turned his speech to M<sup>r</sup>.
      Lyford, and asked him if he thought they had done evill to open his
      letters; but he was silente, &amp; would not say a word, well knowing what
      they might reply. Then y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> shewed the people he
      did it as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>a
      magistrate, and was bound to it by his place, to prevent y<sup>e</sup>
      mischeefe &amp; ruine that this conspiracie and plots of theirs would
      bring on this poor colony. But he, besids his evill dealing hear, had
      delte trecherusly with his freinds y<sup>t</sup> trusted him, &amp; stole
      their letters &amp; opened them, and sent coppies of them, with
      disgracefull an&#773;otations, to his freinds in England. And then y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> produced them and his other letters under his owne hand,
      (which he could not deney,) and caused them to be read before all y<sup>e</sup>
      people; at which all his freinds were blanke, and had not a word to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be too long &amp; tedious here to inserte his letters (which
      would almost fill a volume), though I have them by me. I shall only note a
      few of y<sup>e</sup> cheefe things collected out of them, with y<sup>e</sup>
      answers to them as they were then given; and but a few of those many, only
      for instance, by which the rest may be judged of.

    <p>
      [121<a name="FNanchor_BT_72" id="FNanchor_BT_72"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_BT_72" class="fnanchor">[BT]</a>] 1. First, he saith, the
      church would have none to live hear but them selves. 2<sup>ly</sup>.
      Neither are any willing so to doe if they had company to live elswher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ans: Their answer was, that this was false, in both y<sup>e</sup> parts of
      it; for they were willing &amp; desirous y<sup>t</sup> any honest men may
      live with them, that will cary them selves peacably, and seek y<sup>e</sup>
      com&#773;one good, or at least doe them no hurte. And againe, ther are
      many that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>will
      not live els wher so long as they may live with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That if ther come over any honest men that are not of y<sup>e</sup>
      seperation, they will quickly distast them, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Ther answer was as before, that it was a false callumniation, for they
      had many amongst them that they liked well of, and were glad of their
      company; and should be of any such like that should come amongst them.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. That they excepted against him for these 2. doctrins raised from 2.
      Sam: 12. 7. First, that ministers must sume times perticulerly apply their
      doctrine to spetiall persons; 2<sup>ly</sup>, that great men may be
      reproved as well as meaner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Their answer was, that both these were without either truth or colour
      of y<sup>e</sup> same (as was proved to his face), and that they had
      taught and beleeved these things long before they knew M<sup>r</sup>.
      Liford.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. That they utterly sought y<sup>e</sup> ruine of y<sup>e</sup>
      perticulers; as appeareth by this, that they would not suffer any of y<sup>e</sup>
      generall either to buy or sell with them, or to exchaing one com&#773;oditie
      for another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ans: This was a most malicious slander and voyd of all truth, as was
      evidently proved to him before all men; for any of them did both buy,
      sell, or exchaing with them as often as they had any occation. Yea, and
      allso both lend &amp; give to them when they wanted; and this the
      perticuler persons them selves could not <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>deney, but freely confest in
      open court. But y<sup>e</sup> ground from whence this arose made it much
      worse, for he was in counsell with them. When one was called before them,
      and questioned for receiving powder and bisket from y<sup>e</sup> gun&#773;er
      of the small ship, which was y<sup>e</sup> companys, and had it put in at
      his window in the night, and allso for buying salt of one, that had no
      right to it, he not only stood to back him (being one of these
      perticulers) by excusing &amp; extenuating his falte, as long as he could,
      but upon this builds this mischec&#773;ous &amp; most false slander: That
      because they would not suffer them to buy stolne goods, ergo, they sought
      their utter ruine. Bad logick for a devine.
    </p>

      5. Next he writs, that he chocked them with this; that they turned [122]
      men into their perticuler, and then sought to starve them, and deprive
      them of all means of subsistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. To this was answered, he did them manifest wrong, for they turned none
      into their perticuler; it was their owne importunitie and ernest desire
      that moved them, yea, constrained them to doe it. And they apealed to y<sup>e</sup>
      persons them selves for y<sup>e</sup> truth hereof. And they testified the
      same against him before all present, as allso that they had no cause to
      complaine of any either hard or unkind usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. He accuseth them with unjust distribution, and writeth, that it was a
      strang difference, that some have bene alowed 16<sup>li</sup>. of meale by
      y<sup>e</sup> weeke, and others <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215"
      id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>but 4<sup>li</sup>. And then (floutingly)
      saith, it seems some mens mouths and bellies are very litle &amp; slender
      over others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ans: This might seeme strange indeed to those to whom he write his leters
      in England, which knew not y<sup>e</sup> reason of it; but to him and
      others hear, it could not be strange, who knew how things stood. For the
      first com&#773;ers had none at all, but lived on their corne. Those w<sup>ch</sup>
      <i>came in y<sup>e</sup> Anne, y<sup>e</sup> August before</i>, &amp; were
      to live 13. months of the provissions they brought, had as good alowance
      in meal &amp; pease as it would extend too, y<sup>e</sup> most part of y<sup>e</sup>
      year; but a litle before harvest, when they had not only fish, but other
      fruits began to come in, they had but 4<sup>li</sup>. having their
      libertie to make their owne provisions. But some of these which came last,
      as y<sup>e</sup> ship carpenter, and samiers, the salte-men &amp; others
      that were to follow constante imployments, and had not an howers time,
      from their hard labours, to looke for any thing above their alowance; they
      had at first, 16<sup>li</sup>. alowed them, and afterwards as fish, &amp;
      other food coued be gott, they had as balemente, to 14. &amp;. 12. yea
      some of them to 8. as the times &amp; occasions did vary. And yet those
      which followed planting and their owne occasions, and had but 4<sup>li</sup>.
      of meall a week, lived better then y<sup>e</sup> other, as was well knowne
      to all. And yet it must be remembered that Lyford &amp; his had allwais
      the highest alowance.

    <p>
      Many other things (in his letters) he accused them of, with many
      aggravations; as that he saw exseeding great wast of tools &amp; vesseles;
      &amp; this, when it came to be examened, all y<sup>e</sup> instance he
      could give was, that he had seen an old hogshed or too fallen to peeces,
      and a broken how or tow lefte carlesly in y<sup>e</sup> feilds by some.
      Though he also knew that a godly, honest man was appointed to looke to
      these things. But these things &amp; such like was write of by him, to
      cast disgrace &amp; prejudice upon them; as thinking what came from a
      [123] minister would pass for currente. Then he tells them that Winslow
      should say, that ther was not above 7. of y<sup>e</sup> adventurers y<sup>t</sup>
      souight y<sup>e</sup> good of y<sup>e</sup> collony. That M<sup>r</sup>.
      Oldam &amp; him selfe had had much to doe with them, and that y<sup>e</sup>
      faction here might match y<sup>e</sup> Jesuits for politie. With many y<sup>e</sup>
      like greevious complaints &amp; accusations.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Then, in the next place, he comes to give his freinds counsell and
      directtion. And first, that y<sup>e</sup> Leyden company (M<sup>r</sup>.
      Robinson &amp; y<sup>e</sup> rest) must still be kepte back, or els all
      will be spoyled. And least any of them should be taken in privatly
      somewher on y<sup>e</sup> coast of England, (as it was feared might be
      done,) they must chaing the m<sup>r</sup>. of y<sup>e</sup> ship (M<sup>r</sup>.
      William Peirce), and put another allso in Winslows stead, for marchante,
      or els it would not be prevented.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Then he would have such a number provided as might oversway them hear.
      And that y<sup>e</sup> perticulers <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217"
      id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>should have voyces in all courts &amp;
      elections, and be free to bear any office. And that every perticuler
      should come over as an adventurer, if he be but a servante; some other
      venturing 10<sup>li</sup>., y<sup>e</sup> bill may be taken out in y<sup>e</sup>
      servants name, and then assigned to y<sup>e</sup> party whose money it
      was, and good covenants drawn betweene them for y<sup>e</sup> clearing of
      y<sup>e</sup> matter; and this (saith he) would be a means to strengthen
      this side y<sup>e</sup> more.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Then he tells them that if that Capten they spoake of should come over
      hither as a generall, he was perswaded he would be chosen Capten; for this
      Captaine Standish looks like a silly boy, and is in utter contempte.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Then he shows that if by y<sup>e</sup> forementioned means they cannot
      be strengthened to cary &amp; overbear things, it will be best for them to
      plant els wher by them selves; and would have it artickled by them that
      they might make choyse of any place that they liked best within 3. or 4.
      myls distance, shewing ther were farr better places for plantation then
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. And lastly he concluds, that if some number came not over to bear them
      up here, then ther would be no abiding for them, but by joyning with these
      hear. Then he adds: Since I begane to write, ther are letters come from
      your company, wherin they would give sole authoritie in diverce things
      unto the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>Gov<sup>r</sup>
      here; which, if it take place, then, <i>Ve nobis</i>. But I hope you will
      be more vigilante hereafter, that nothing may pass in such a man&#773;er.
      I suppose (saith he) M<sup>r</sup>. Oldame will write to you further of
      these things. I pray you conceall me in the discovery of these things,
      &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus I have breefly touched some cheefe things in his leters, and shall
      now returne to their procceeding with him. After the reading of his leters
      before the whole company, he was demanded what he could say to these
      things. [124] But all y<sup>e</sup> answer he made was, that Billington
      and some others had informed him of many things, and made sundrie
      complaints, which they now deneyed. He was againe asked if that was a
      sufficiente ground for him thus to accuse &amp; traduse them by his
      letters, and never say word to them, considering the many bonds betweene
      them. And so they went on from poynte to poynte; and wisht him, or any of
      his freinds &amp; confederats, not to spare them in any thing; if he or
      they had any proofe or witnes of any corrupte or evill dealing of theirs,
      his or their evidence must needs be ther presente, for ther was the whole
      company and sundery strangers. He said he had been abused by others in
      their informations, (as he now well saw,) and so had abused them. And this
      was all the answer they could have, for none would take his parte in any
      thing; but Billington, &amp; any whom he named, deneyed the things, and
      protested he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>wronged
      them, and would have drawne them to such &amp; such things which they
      could not consente too, though they were sometimes drawne to his meetings.
      Then they delte with him aboute his dissembling with them aboute y<sup>e</sup>
      church, and that he professed to concur with them in all things, and what
      a large confession he made at his admittance, and that he held not him
      selfe a minister till he had a new calling, &amp;c. And yet now he
      contested against them, and drew a company aparte, &amp; sequestred him
      selfe; and would goe minister the sacrements (by his Episcopall caling)
      without ever speaking a word unto them, either as magistrats or bretheren.
      In conclusion, he was fully convicted, and burst out into tears, and
      "confest he feared he was a reprobate, his sinns were so great that he
      doubted God would not pardon them, he was unsavorie salte, &amp;c.; and
      that he had so wronged them as he could never make them amends, confessing
      all he had write against them was false &amp; nought, both for matter
      &amp; man&#773;er." And all this he did with as much fullnes as words
      &amp; tears could express.
    </p>
    <p>
      After their triall &amp; conviction, the court censured them to be expeld
      the place; Oldame presently, though his wife &amp; family had liberty to
      stay all winter, or longer, till he could make provission to remove them
      comfortably. Lyford had liberty to stay 6. months. It was, indeede, with
      some eye to his release, if he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220"
      id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>caried him selfe well in the meane time, and
      that his repentance proved sound. Lyford acknowledged his censure was farr
      less then he deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, he confest his sin publikly in y<sup>e</sup> church, with
      tears more largly then before. I shall here put it downe as I find it
      recorded by some who tooke it from his owne words, as him selfe utered
      them. Acknowledging [125] "That he had don very evill, and slanderously
      abused them; and thinking most of y<sup>e</sup> people would take parte
      with him, he thought to cary all by violence and strong hand against them.
      And that God might justly lay in&#773;ocente blood to his charge, for he
      knew not what hurt might have come of these his writings, and blest God
      they were stayed. And that he spared not to take knowledg from any, of any
      evill that was spoaken, but shut his eyes &amp; ears against all the good;
      and if God should make him a vacabund in y<sup>e</sup> earth, as was
      Caine, it was but just, for he had sined in envie &amp; malice against his
      brethren as he did. And he confessed 3. things to be y<sup>e</sup> ground
      &amp; causes of these his doings: pride, vaine-glorie, &amp; selfe love."
      Amplifying these heads with many other sade expressions, in the
      perticulers of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So as they begane againe to conceive good thoughts of him upon this his
      repentance, and admited him to teach amongst them as before; and Samuell
      Fuller (a deacon amongst them), and some other tender harted <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>men
      amongst them, were so taken with his signes of sorrow &amp; repentance, as
      they professed they would fall upon their knees to have his censure
      released.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that which made them all stand amased in the end, and may doe all
      others that shall come to hear y<sup>e</sup> same, (for a rarer president
      can scarse be showne,) was, that after a month or 2. notwithstand all his
      former conffessions, convictions, and publick acknowledgments, both in y<sup>e</sup>
      face of y<sup>e</sup> church and whole company, with so many tears &amp;
      sadde censures of him selfe before God &amp; men, he should goe againe to
      justifie what he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      For secretly he write a 2<sup>d</sup>. leter to y<sup>e</sup> adventurers
      in England, in w<sup>ch</sup> he justified all his former writings, (save
      in some things which tended to their damage,) the which, because it is

        my perticuler leters w<sup>ch</sup> I wrote to private freinds, for y<sup>e</sup>
        courses in coming hither &amp; the like; which I doe in no sorte seeke
        to justifie, though stired up ther unto in the beholding y<sup>e</sup>
        indirecte courses held by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222"
        id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>others, both hear, &amp; ther with you,
        for effecting their designes. But am hartily sory for it, and doe to y<sup>e</sup>
        glory of God &amp; mine owne shame acknowledg it. Which leters being
        intercepted by the Gov<sup>r</sup>, I have for y<sup>e</sup> same
        undergone y<sup>e</sup> censure [126] of banishmente. And had it not
        been for y<sup>e</sup> respecte I have unto you, and some other matters
        of private regard, I had returned againe at this time by y<sup>e</sup>
        pinass for England; for hear I purpose not to abide, unless I receive
        better incouragmente from you, then from y<sup>e</sup> church (as they
        call them selves) here I doe receive. I purposed before I came, to
        undergoe hardnes, therfore I shall I hope cherfully bear y<sup>e</sup>
        conditions of y<sup>e</sup> place, though very mean; and they have
        chainged my wages ten times allready. I suppose my letters, or at least
        y<sup>e</sup> coppies of them, are come to your hands, for so they hear
        reporte; which, if it be so, I pray you take notice of this, that I have
        writen nothing but what is certainly true, and I could make so apeare
        planly to any indifferente men, whatsoever colours be cast to darken y<sup>e</sup>
        truth, and some ther are very audatious this way; besids many other
        matters which are farre out of order hear. My mind was not to enlarge my
        selfe any further, but in respecte of diverse poore souls here, y<sup>e</sup>
        care of whom in parte belongs to you, being here destitute of the me&#257;s
        of salvation. For how so ever y<sup>e</sup> church are provided for, to
        their contente, who are y<sup>e</sup> smalest number in y<sup>e</sup>

        houlding this principle, that y<sup>e</sup> Lord hath not appointed any
        ordinary ministrie for y<sup>e</sup> conversion of those y<sup>t</sup>
        are without, so y<sup>t</sup> some of y<sup>e</sup> poor souls have w<sup>th</sup>
        tears complained of this to me, and I was taxed for preaching to all in
        generall. Though in truth they have had no ministrie here since they
        came, but such as may be performed by any of you, by their owne
        possition, what soever great pretences they make; but herin they

      They made a breefe answer to some things in this leter, but referred
      cheefly to their former. The effecte was to this purpose: That if God in
      his providence had not brought these things to their hands (both y<sup>e</sup>
      former &amp; later), they might have been thus abused, tradused, and
      calumniated, overthrowne, &amp; undone; and never have knowne by whom, nor
      for what. They desired but this equall favoure, that they would be pleased
      to hear their just defence, as well as his accusations, and waigh them in
      y<sup>e</sup> balance of justice &amp; reason, and then censure as they
      pleased. They had write breefly to y<sup>e</sup> heads of things before,
      and should be ready to give further [127] answer as any occasion should
      require; craving leave to adde a word or tow to this last.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. And first, they desire to examene what filth that was y<sup>t</sup> he
      acknowledgeth might justly be throwne in his face, and might cause
      blushing &amp; perpetuall silence; some great mater sure! But if it be
      looked into, it amounts to no more then a poynte of indiscretion, and
      thats all; and yet he licks of y<sup>t</sup> too with this excuse, that he
      was stired up therunto by beholding <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup> indirecte
      course here. But this point never troubled him here, it was counted a
      light matter both by him &amp; his freinds, and put of with this,&mdash;that
      any man might doe so, to advise his private freinds to come over for their
      best advantage. All his sorrow &amp; tears here was for y<sup>e</sup>
      wrong &amp; hurt he had done us, and not at all for this he pretends to be
      done to you: it was not counted so much as indiscretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Having thus payed you full satisfaction, he thinks he may lay load of
      us here. And first complains that we have changed his wages ten times. We
      never agreed with him for any wages, nor made any bargen at all with him,
      neither know of any that you have made. You sent him over to teach amongst
      us, and desired he might be kindly used; and more then this we know not.
      That he hath beene kindly used, (and farr beter then he deserves from us,)
      he shall be judged first of his owne mouth. If you please to looke upon
      that writing of his, that was sent you amongst his leters, which he cals a
      generall relation, in which, though he doth otherwise traduse us, yet in
      this he him selfe clears us. In y<sup>e</sup> latter end therof he hath
      these words. <i>I speak not this</i> (saith he) <i>out of any ill
      affection to the men, for I have found them very kind &amp; loving to me.</i>
      You may ther see these to be his owne words under his owne hand. 2<sup>ly</sup>.
      It will appere by this that he hath ever had a larger alowance of food
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>out
      of y<sup>e</sup> store for him and his then any, and clothing as his neede
      hath required; a dwelling in one of our best houses, and a man wholy at
      his owne com&#773;and to tend his private affairs. What cause he hath
      therfore to complaine, judge ye; and what he means in his speech we know
      not, except he aluds to y<sup>t</sup> of Jaacob &amp; Laban. If you have
      promised him more or other wise, you may doe it when you please.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Then with an impudente face he would have you take notice, that (in his
      leters) he hath write nothing but what is certainly true, yea, and he
      could make it so appeare plainly to any indifferente men. This indeed doth
      astonish us and causeth us to tremble at y<sup>e</sup> deceitfullnes [128]
      and desperate wickednes of mans harte. This is to devoure holy things, and
      after voues to enquire. It is admirable that after such publick
      confession, and acknowledgmente in court, in church, before God, &amp;
      men, with such sadd expressions as he used, and with such melting into
      teares, that after all this he shoud now justifie all againe. If things
      had bene done in a corner, it had been some thinge to deney them; but
      being done in y<sup>e</sup> open view of y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie &amp;
      before all men, it is more then strange now to avow to make them plainly
      appear to any indifferente men; and here wher things were done, and all y<sup>e</sup>
      evidence that could be were presente, and yet could make nothing appear,
      but even <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>his
      freinds condemnd him &amp; gave their voyce to his censure, so grose were
      they; we leave your selves to judge herein. Yet least this man should
      triumph in his wikednes, we shall be ready to answer him, when, or wher
      you will, to any thing he shall lay to our charg, though we have done it
      sufficiently allready.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Then he saith he would not inlarge, but for some poore souls here who
      are destiute of y<sup>e</sup> means of salvation, &amp;c. But all his
      soothing is but that you would use means, that his censure might be
      released that he might here continue; and under you (at least) be
      sheltered, till he sees what his freinds (on whom he depends) can bring
      about &amp; effecte. For such men pretend much for poor souls, but they
      will looke to their wages &amp; conditions; if that be not to their
      content, let poor souls doe what they will, they will shift for them
      selves, and seek poore souls some wher els among richer bodys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next he fals upon y<sup>e</sup> church, that indeed is y<sup>e</sup>
      burthensome stone that troubls him. First, he saith they hold this
      principle, that the Lord hath not apointed any ordinarie ministrie for y<sup>e</sup>
      converssion of those without. The church needs not be ashamed of what she
      houlds in this, haveing Gods word for her warrente; that ordinarie
      officers are bound cheefly to their flocks, Acts 20. 28. and are not to be
      extravagants, to goe, come, and leave them at their pleasurs to shift for
      them selves, or to be devoured of wolves. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>But he perverts y<sup>e</sup>
      truth in this as in other things, for y<sup>e</sup> Lord hath as well
      appoynted them to converte, as to feede in their severall charges; and he
      wrongs y<sup>e</sup> church to say other wise. Againe, he saith he was
      taxed for preaching to all in generall. This is a meere untruth, for this
      dissembler knows that every Lords day some are appointed to visite
      suspected places, &amp; if any be found idling and neglecte y<sup>e</sup>
      hearing of y<sup>e</sup> word, (through idlnes or profanes,) they are
      punished for y<sup>e</sup> same. Now to procure all to come to hear, and
      then to blame him for preaching to all, were to play y<sup>e</sup> mad
      men.

      soever pretences they make, &amp;c. We answer, the more is our wrong, that
      our pastor is kept from us by these mens means, and then reproach us for
      it when they have done. Yet have we not been wholy distitute of y<sup>e</sup>
      means of salvation, as this man would make y<sup>e</sup> world beleeve;
      for our reve<sup>d</sup> Elder hath laboured diligently in dispencing the
      word of God unto us, before he came; and since hath taken equalle pains
      with him selfe in preaching the same; and, be it spoaken without
      ostentation, he is not inferriour to M<sup>r</sup>. Lyford (&amp; some of
      his betters) either in gifts or larning, though he would never be
      perswaded to take higher office upon him. Nor ever was more pretended in
      this matter. For equivocating, he may take it to <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>him selfe; what y<sup>e</sup>
      church houlds, they have manifested to y<sup>e</sup> world, in all
      plaines, both in open confession, doctrine, &amp; writing.

      This was y<sup>e</sup> sume of ther answer, and hear I will let them rest
      for y<sup>e</sup> presente. I have bene longer in these things then I
      desired, and yet not so long as the things might require, for I pass many
      things in silence, and many more deserve to have been more largly handled.
      But I will returne to other things, and leave y<sup>e</sup> rest to its
      place.

      The pinass that was left sunck &amp; cast away near Damarins-cove, as is
      before showed, some of y<sup>e</sup> fishing maisters said it was a pity
      so fine a vessell should be lost, and sent them word that, if they would
      be at y<sup>e</sup> cost, they would both directe them how to waygh her,
      and let them have their carpenters to mend her. They thanked them, &amp;
      sente men aboute it, and beaver to defray y<sup>e</sup> charge, (without
      which all had been in vaine). So they gott coopers to trime, I know not
      how many tune of cask, and being made tight and fastened to her at
      low-water, they boyed her up; and then with many hands hald her on shore
      in a conveniente place wher she might be wrought upon; and then hired
      sundrie carpenters to work upon her, and other to saw planks, and at last
      fitted her &amp; got her home. But she cost a great deale of money, in
      thus recovering her, and buying riging &amp; seails for her, both now
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>and
      when before she lost her mast; so as she proved a chargable vessell to y<sup>e</sup>
      poor plantation. So they sent her home, and with her Lyford sent his last
      letter, in great secrecie; but y<sup>e</sup> party intrusted with it gave
      it y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter was passed over in ther ordinarie affairs, without any spetiall
      mater worth noteing; saveing that many who before stood something of from
      y<sup>e</sup> church, now seeing Lyfords unrighteous dealing, and
      malignitie against y<sup>e</sup> church, now tendered them selves to y<sup>e</sup>
      church, and were joyned to y<sup>e</sup> same; proffessing that it was not
      out of y<sup>e</sup> dislike of any thing that they had stood of so long,
      but a desire to fitte them selves beter for such a state, and they saw now
      y<sup>e</sup> Lord cald for their help. [130] And so these troubls
      prodused a quite contrary effecte in sundrie hear, then these adversaries
      hoped for. Which was looked at as a great worke of God, to draw on men by
      unlickly means; and that in reason which might rather have set them
      further of. And thus I shall end this year.

      At y<sup>e</sup> spring of y<sup>e</sup> year, about y<sup>e</sup> time of
      their Election Court, Oldam came againe amongst them; and though it was a
      part of his censure for his former mutinye and miscariage, not to returne
      without leave first obtained, yet in his dareing spirite, he presumed
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>without
      any leave at all, being also set on &amp; hardened by y<sup>e</sup> ill
      counsell of others. And not only so, but suffered his unruly passion to
      rune beyond y<sup>e</sup> limits of all reason and modestie; in so much
      that some strangers which came with him were ashamed of his outrage, and
      rebuked him; but all reprofes were but as oyle to y<sup>e</sup> fire, and
      made y<sup>e</sup> flame of his coller greater. He caled them all to
      nought, in this his mad furie, and a hundred rebells and traytors, and I
      know not what. But in conclusion they com&#773;ited him till he was tamer,
      and then apointed a gard of musketers w<sup>ch</sup> he was to pass throw,
      and ever one was ordered to give him a thump on y<sup>e</sup> brich, with
      y<sup>e</sup> but end of his musket, and then was conveied to y<sup>e</sup>
      water side, wher a boat was ready to cary him away. Then they bid him goe
      &amp; mende his maners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst this was a doing, M<sup>r</sup>. William Peirce and M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winslow came up from y<sup>e</sup> water side, being come from England;
      but they were so busie with Oldam, as they never saw them till they came
      thus upon them. They bid them not spare either him or Liford, for they had
      played y<sup>e</sup> vilans with them. But that I may hear make an end
      with him, I shall hear once for all relate what befell concerning him in y<sup>e</sup>
      future, &amp; y<sup>t</sup> breefly. After y<sup>e</sup> removall of his
      familie from hence, he fell into some straits, (as some others did,) and
      aboute a year or more afterwards, towards winter, he intended a vioage for
      Virginia; but it so <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>pleased
      God that y<sup>e</sup> barke that caried him, and many other passengers,
      was in that danger, as they dispaired of life; so as many of them, as they
      fell to prayer, so also did they begine to examine their consciences [131]
      and confess such sins as did most burthen them. And M<sup>r</sup>. Ouldame
      did make a free and large confession of y<sup>e</sup> wrongs and hurt he
      had done to y<sup>e</sup> people and church here, in many perticulers,
      that as he had sought their ruine, so God had now mette with him and might
      destroy him; yea, he feared they all fared y<sup>e</sup> worce for his
      sake; he prayed God to forgive him, and made vowes that, if y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord spard his life, he would become otherwise, and y<sup>e</sup> like.
      This I had from some of good credite, yet living in y<sup>e</sup> Bay, and
      were them selves partners in the same dangers on y<sup>e</sup> shoulds of
      Cap-Codd, and heard it from his owne mouth. It pleased God to spare their
      lives, though they lost their viage; and in time after wards, Ouldam
      caried him selfe fairly towards them, and acknowledged y<sup>e</sup> hand
      of God to be with them, and seemed to have an honourable respecte of them;
      and so farr made his peace with them, as he in after time had libertie to
      goe and come, and converse with them, at his pleasure. He went after this
      to Virginia, and had ther a great sicknes, but recovered and came back
      againe to his familie in y<sup>e</sup> Bay, and ther lived till some store
      of people came over. At lenght going a trading in a smale vessell <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>among y<sup>e</sup>
      Indians, and being weakly mand, upon some quarell they knockt him on y<sup>e</sup>
      head with a hatched, so as he fell downe dead, &amp; never spake word
      more. 2. litle boys that were his kinsmen were saved, but had some hurte,
      and y<sup>e</sup> vessell was strangly recovered from y<sup>e</sup>
      Indeans by another that belonged to y<sup>e</sup> Bay of Massachusets; and
      this his death was one ground of the Pequente warr which followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am now come to M<sup>r</sup>. Lyford. His time being now expired, his
      censure was to take place. He was so farre from answering their hopes by
      amendmente in y<sup>e</sup> time, as he had dubled his evill, as is before
      noted. But first behold y<sup>e</sup> hand of God conceir&#773;ing him,
      wherin that of y<sup>e</sup> Psalmist is verified. Psa: 7. 15. He hath
      made a pitte, &amp; digged it, and is fallen into the pitte he made. He
      thought to bring shame and disgrace upon them, but in stead therof opens
      his owne to all y<sup>e</sup> world. For when he was delte with all aboute
      his second letter, his wife was so affected with his doings, as she could
      no longer conceaill her greefe and sorrow of minde, but opens y<sup>e</sup>
      same to one of their deacons &amp; some other of her freinds, &amp; after
      uttered y<sup>e</sup> same to M<sup>r</sup>. Peirce upon his arrivall.
      Which was to this purpose, that she feared some great judgment of God
      would fall upon them, and upon her, for her husbands cause; now that they
      were to remove, she feared to fall into y<sup>e</sup> Indeans hands, and
      to be defiled by them, as he had <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233"
      id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>defiled other women; or some shuch like
      [132] judgmente, as God had threatened David, 2. Sam. 12. 11. I will raise
      up evill against y<sup>e</sup>, and will take thy wives &amp; give them,
      &amp;c. And upon it showed how he had wronged her, as first he had a
      bastard by another before they were maried, &amp; she having some inkling
      of some ill cariage that way, when he was a suitor to her, she tould him
      what she heard, &amp; deneyd him; but she not certainly knowing y<sup>e</sup>
      thing, other wise then by some darke &amp; secrete muterings, he not only
      stifly denied it, but to satisfie her tooke a solemne oath ther was no
      shuch matter. Upon which she gave consente, and maried with him; but
      afterwards it was found true, and y<sup>e</sup> bastard brought home to
      them. She then charged him with his oath, but he prayed pardon, and said
      he should els not have had her. And yet afterwards she could keep no maids
      but he would be medling with them, and some time she hath taken him in y<sup>e</sup>
      maner, as they lay at their beds feete, with shuch other circumstances as
      I am ashamed to relate. The woman being a grave matron, &amp; of good
      cariage all y<sup>e</sup> while she was hear, and spoake these things out
      of y<sup>e</sup> sorrow of her harte, sparingly, and yet w<sup>th</sup>
      some further intimations. And that which did most seeme to affecte her (as
      they conceived) was, to see his former cariage in his repentance, not only
      hear with y<sup>e</sup> church, but formerly about these things; sheding
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>tears,
      and using great &amp; sade expressions, and yet eftsone fall into the like
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing of y<sup>e</sup> same nature did strangly concurr herewith.
      When M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Peirce were come over, M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winslow informed them that they had had y<sup>e</sup> like bickering with
      Lyfords freinds in England, as they had with him selfe and his freinds
      hear, aboute his letters &amp; accusations in them. And many meetings and
      much clamour was made by his freinds theraboute, crying out, a minister, a
      man so godly, to be so esteemed &amp; taxed they held a great skandale,
      and threated to prosecute law against them for it. But things being
      referred to a further meeting of most of y<sup>e</sup> adventurers, to
      heare y<sup>e</sup> case and decide y<sup>e</sup> matters, they agreed to
      chose 2. eminente men for moderators in the bussines. Lyfords faction
      chose M<sup>r</sup>. White, a counselor at law, the other parte chose Rev&#771;e<sup>d</sup>.
      M<sup>r</sup>. Hooker, the minister, and many freinds on both sids were
      brought in, so as ther was a great assemblie. In y<sup>e</sup> mean time,
      God in his providence had detected Lyford's evill cariage in Ireland to
      some freinds amongst y<sup>e</sup> company, who made it knowne to M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winslow, and directed him to 2. godly and grave witnesses, who would
      testifie y<sup>e</sup> same (if caled therunto) upon their oath. The thing
      was this; he being gott into Ireland, had wound him selfe into y<sup>e</sup>
      esteeme of sundry godly &amp; zelous professours in those parts, who,
      having been burthened with y<sup>e</sup> ceremonies in England, found ther
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>some
      more liberty to their consciences; amongst whom were these 2. men, which
      gave [133] this evidence. Amongst y<sup>e</sup> rest of his hearers, ther
      was a godly yonge man that intended to marie, and cast his affection on a
      maide which lived their aboute; but desiring to chose in y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord, and preferred y<sup>e</sup> fear of God before all other things,
      before he suffered his affection to rune too farr, he resolved to take M<sup>r</sup>.
      Lyfords advise and judgmente of this maide, (being y<sup>e</sup> minister
      of y<sup>e</sup> place,) and so broak y<sup>e</sup> matter unto him; &amp;
      he promised faithfully to informe him, but would first take better
      knowledg of her, and have private conferance with her; and so had sundry
      times; and in conclusion com&#773;ended her highly to y<sup>e</sup> yong
      man as a very fitte wife for him. So they were maried togeather; but some
      time after mariage the woman was much troubled in mind, and afflicted in
      conscience, and did nothing but weepe and mourne, and long it was before
      her husband could get of her what was y<sup>e</sup> cause. But at length
      she discovered y<sup>e</sup> thing, and prayed him to forgive her, for
      Lyford had overcome her, and defiled her body before marriage, after he
      had comended him unto her for a husband, and she resolved to have him,
      when he came to her in that private way. The circumstances I forbear, for
      they would offend chast ears to hear them related, (for though he
      satisfied his lust on her, yet he indeaoured to hinder conception.) These
      things being thus discovered, y<sup>e</sup> wom&#257;s husband tooke some
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>godly
      freinds with him, to deale with Liford for this evill. At length he
      confest it, with a great deale of seeming sorrow &amp; repentance, but was
      forct to leave Irland upon it, partly for shame, and partly for fear of
      further punishmente, for y<sup>e</sup> godly withdrew them selves from him
      upon it; and so com&#773;ing into England unhapily he was light upon &amp;
      sente hither.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this great assembly, and before y<sup>e</sup> moderators, in
      handling y<sup>e</sup> former matters aboute y<sup>e</sup> letters, upon
      provocation, in some heate of replie to some of Lyfords defenders, M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winslow let fall these words, That he had delte knavishly; upon which on
      of his freinds tooke hold, &amp; caled for witneses, that he cald a
      minister of y<sup>e</sup> gospell knave, and would prosecute law upon it,
      which made a great tumulte, upon which (to be shorte) this matter broke
      out, and the witnes were prodused, whose persons were so grave, and
      evidence so plaine, and y<sup>e</sup> facte so foule, yet delivered in
      such modest &amp; chast terms, and with such circumstances, as strucke all
      his freinds mute, and made them all ashamed; insomuch as y<sup>e</sup>
      moderators with great gravitie declared that y<sup>e</sup> former matters
      gave them cause enough to refuse him &amp; to deal with him as they had
      done, but these made him unmeete for ever to bear ministrie any more, what
      repentance soever he should pretend; with much more to like effecte, and
      so wisht his freinds to rest quiete. Thus was this matter ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      From hence Lyford wente to Natasco, in y<sup>e</sup> Bay of <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachusets, with some other of his freinds with him, wher Oldom allso
      lived. From thence he removed to Namkeke, since called Salem; but after
      ther came some people over, wheather for hope of greater profite, or what
      ends els I know not, he left his freinds that followed him, and went from
      thence to Virginia, wher he shortly after dyed, and so I leave him to y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord. His wife afterwards returned againe to this cuntry, and thus much of
      this matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      [134] This storme being thus blowne over, yet sundrie sad effects followed
      y<sup>e</sup> same; for the Company of Adventurers broake in peeces here
      upon, and y<sup>e</sup> greatest parte wholy deserted y<sup>e</sup> colony
      in regarde of any further supply, or care of their subsistance. And not
      only so, but some of Lyfords &amp; Oldoms freinds, and their adherents,
      set out a shipe on fishing, on their owne accounte, and getting y<sup>e</sup>
      starte of y<sup>e</sup> ships that came to the plantation, they tooke away
      their stage, &amp; other necessary provisions that they had made for
      fishing at Cap-Anne y<sup>e</sup> year before, at their great charge, and
      would not restore y<sup>e</sup> same, excepte they would fight for it. But
      y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> sent some of y<sup>e</sup> planters to help
      y<sup>e</sup> fisher men to build a new one, and so let them keepe it.
      This shipe also brought them some small supply, of little value; but they
      made so pore a bussines of their fishing, (neither could these men make
      them any returne for y<sup>e</sup> supply sente,) so as, after this year,
      they never looked more after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Also by this ship, they, some of them, sent (in y<sup>e</sup> name of y<sup>e</sup>
      rest) certaine reasons of their breaking of from y<sup>e</sup> plantation,
      and some tenders, upon certaine conditions, of reuniting againe. The which
      because they are longe &amp; tedious, and most of them aboute the former
      things already touched, I shall omite them; only giveing an instance in
      one, or tow. 1. reason, they charged them for dissembling with his
      majestie in their petition, and with y<sup>e</sup> adventurers about y<sup>e</sup>
      French discipline, &amp;c. 2<sup>ly</sup>, for receiving<a
      name="FNanchor_BV_74" id="FNanchor_BV_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_BV_74"
      class="fnanchor">[BV]</a> a man<a name="FNanchor_BW_75" id="FNanchor_BW_75"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_BW_75" class="fnanchor">[BW]</a> into their church, that
      in his conffession renownced all, universall, nationall, and diocessan
      churches, &amp;c., by which (say they) it appears, that though they deney
      the name of Brow&#773;ists, yet they practiss y<sup>e</sup> same, &amp;c.
      And therfore they should sin&#773;e against God in building up such a
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they adde: Our dislikes thus laid downe, that we may goe on in trade
      w<sup>th</sup> better contente &amp; credite, our desires are as
      followeth. First, that as we are partners in trade, so we may be in Gov&#771;<sup>rt</sup>
      ther, as the patente doth give us power, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That the French discipline may be practised in the plantation, as well
      in the circumstances theirof, as in y<sup>e</sup> substance; wherby y<sup>e</sup>
      scandallous name of y<sup>e</sup> Brownists, and other church differences,
      may be taken away.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Lastly, that M<sup>r</sup>. Robinson and his company may not goe over
      to our plantation, unless he and they <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>will reconcile themselves to
      our church by a recantation under their hands, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their answer in part to these things was then as foloweth.
    </p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        Wheras you taxe us for dissembling with his majestie &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
        adventurers aboute y<sup>e</sup> French discipline, you doe us wrong,
        for we both hold &amp; practice y<sup>e</sup> discipline of y<sup>e</sup>
        French &amp; other reformed churches, (as they have published y<sup>e</sup>
        same in y<sup>e</sup> Harmony of Confessions,) according to our means,
        in effecte &amp; substance. But wheras you would tye us to the French
        discipline in every circumstance, you derogate from y<sup>e</sup>
        libertie we have in Christ Jesus. The Apostle Paule would have none to
        follow him in any thing but wherin he follows Christ, much less ought
        any Christian or church in y<sup>e</sup> world to doe it. The French may
        erre, we may erre, and other churches may erre, and doubtless doe in
        many circumstances. That honour therfore belongs only to y<sup>e</sup>
        infallible word of God, and pure Testamente of Christ, to be propounded
        and followed as y<sup>e</sup> only rule and pattern for direction herin
        to all churches &amp; Christians. And it is too great arrogancie for any

        y<sup>e</sup> word of God to y<sup>e</sup> bottome, as precislie to sett

        To our loving freinds, &amp;c.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though the thing we feared be come upon us, and y<sup>e</sup> evill we
        strove against have overtaken us, yet we cannot forgett you, nor our
        freindship and fellowship which togeather we have had some years; wherin
        though our expressions have been small, yet our harty affections towards
        you (unknown by face) have been no less then to our nearest freinds,
        yea, to our owne selves. And though this your friend M<sup>r</sup>.
        Winslow can tell you y<sup>e</sup> state of things hear, yet least we
        should seeme to neglecte you, to whom, by a wonderfull providence of
        God, we are so nearly united, we have thought good once more to write
        unto you, to let you know what is here befallen, and y<sup>e</sup>
        resons of it; as also our purposes &amp; desirs toward you for
        hereafter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The former course for the generalitie here is wholy dissolved from what
        it was; and wheras you &amp; we were formerly sharers and partners, in
        all viages &amp; deallings, this way is now no more, but you and we are
        left to bethinke our sellves what course to take in y<sup>e</sup>
        future, that your lives &amp; our monies be not lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reasons and causes of this allteration have been these. First and
        mainly, y<sup>e</sup> many losses and crosses at sea, and abuses of
        sea-men, w<sup>ch</sup> have caused us to rune into so much charge,
        debts, &amp; ingagements, as our estats &amp; means were not able to goe
        on without impoverishing our selves, except our estats had been greater,
        and our associats cloven beter unto us. 2<sup>ly</sup>, as here hath
        been a faction and siding amongst us now more then 2. years, so now
        there is an uter breach and sequestration amongst us, and in too parts
        of us a full dissertion and forsaking of you, without any intente or
        purpose of medling more with you. And though we are perswaded <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>the
        maine cause of this their doing is wante of money, (for neede wherof men
        use to make many excuses,) yet other things are pretended, as that you
        are Brownists, &amp;c. Now what use you or we ought to make of these
        things, it remaineth to be considered, for we know y<sup>e</sup> hand of
        God to be in all these things, and no doubt he would admonish some thing
        therby, and to looke what is amise. And allthough it be now too late for
        us or you to prevent &amp; stay these things, yet it is<a
        name="FNanchor_BX_76" id="FNanchor_BX_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_BX_76"
        class="fnanchor">[BX]</a> not to late to exercise patience, wisdom, and
        conscience in bearing them, and in caring our selves in &amp; under them
        for y<sup>e</sup> time to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        [136] And as we our selves stand ready to imbrace all occasions that may
        tend to y<sup>e</sup> furthrance of so hopefull a work, rather admiring
        of what is, then grudging for what is not; so it must rest in you to
        make all good againe. And if in nothing else you can be approved, yet
        let your honestie &amp; conscience be still approved, &amp; lose not one
        jote of you<sup>r</sup> innocencie, amids your crosses &amp;
        afflictions. And surly if you upon this allteration behave your selves
        wisly, and goe on fairly, as men whose hope is not in this life, you
        shall need no other weapon to wound your adversaries; for when your
        righteousnes is revealled as y<sup>e</sup> light, they shall cover their
        faces with shame, that causlesly have sought your overthrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we thinke it but reason, that all such things as ther apertaine to
        the generall, be kept &amp; preserved togeather, and rather increased
        dayly, then any way be dispersed or imbeseled away for any private ends
        or intents whatsoever. And after your necessities are served, you gather
        togeather such com&#773;odities as y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie yeelds, &amp;
        send them over to pay debts &amp; clear ingagements hear, which are not
        less then 1400<sup>li</sup>. And we hope you will doe your best to free
        our ingagements, &amp;c. Let us all indeavor to keep a faire &amp;
        honest course, and see <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242"
        id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>what time will bring forth, and how God in
        his providence will worke for us. We still are perswaded you are y<sup>e</sup>
        people that must make a plantation in those remoate places when all
        others faile and returne. And your experience of Gods providence and
        preservation of you is such as we hope your harts will not faile you,
        though your freinds should forsake you (which we our selves shall not
        doe whilst we live, so long as your honestie so well appereth). Yet
        surly help would arise from some other place whilst you waite on God,
        with uprightnes, though we should leave you allso.
      </p>
      <p>
        And lastly be you all intreated to walke circumspectly, and carry your
        selves so uprightly in all your ways, as y<sup>t</sup> no man may make
        just exceptions against you. And more espetially that y<sup>e</sup>
        favour and countenance of God may be so toward you, as y<sup>t</sup> you
        may find abundante joye &amp; peace even amids tribulations, that you
        may say with David, Though my father &amp; mother should forsake me, yet
        y<sup>e</sup> Lord would take me up.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have sent you hear some catle, cloath, hose, shoes, leather, &amp;c.,
        but in another nature then formerly, as it stood us in hand to doe; we
        have com&#773;itted them to y<sup>e</sup> charge &amp; custody of M<sup>r</sup>.
        Allerton and M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow, as our factours, at whose
        discretion they are to be sould, and com&#773;odities to be taken for
        them, as is fitting. And by how much y<sup>e</sup> more they will be

        comfortably, pluck up your spirits, and quitte your selves like men in
        all your difficulties, that notwithstanding all displeasure and threats
        of men, yet y<sup>e</sup> work may goe on you are aboute, and not be
        neglected. Which is so much for y<sup>e</sup> glorie of God, and the
        furthrance of our countrie-men, as that a man may with more comforte
        [137] spend his life in it, then live y<sup>e</sup> life of Mathusala,
        in wasting y<sup>e</sup> plentie of a tilled land, or eating y<sup>e</sup>

      By this leter it appears in what state y<sup>e</sup> affairs of y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation stood at this time. These goods they bought, but they were at
      deare rates, for they put 40. in y<sup>e</sup> hundred upon them, for
      profite and adventure, outward bound; and because of y<sup>e</sup> v&#773;nture
      of y<sup>e</sup> paiment homeward, they would have 30.<a
      name="FNanchor_BZ_78" id="FNanchor_BZ_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_BZ_78"
      class="fnanchor">[BZ]</a> in y<sup>e</sup> 100. more, which was in all 70.
      p&#818;<sup>r</sup>. cent; a thing thought unreasonable by some, and too
      great an oppression upon y<sup>e</sup> poore people, as their case stood.
      The catle were y<sup>e</sup> best goods, for y<sup>e</sup> other being
      ventured ware, were neither at y<sup>e</sup> best (some of them) nor at y<sup>e</sup>
      best prises. Sundrie of their freinds disliked these high rates, but com&#773;ing
      from many hands, they could not help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sent over also 2. ships on fishing on their owne acounte; the one was
      y<sup>e</sup> pinass that was cast away y<sup>e</sup> last year hear in y<sup>e</sup>
      cuntrie, and recovered by y<sup>e</sup> planters, (as was before related,)
      who, after she came home, was attached by one of y<sup>e</sup> company for
      his perticuler debte, and now sent againe on this accounte. The other was
      a great ship, who was well fitted with an experienced m<sup>r</sup>. &amp;
      company of fisher-men, to make a viage, &amp; to goe to Bilbo or
      Sabastians with her fish; the lesser, her order was <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>to load with cor-fish, and
      to bring the beaver home for England, y<sup>t</sup> should be received for
      y<sup>e</sup> goods sould to y<sup>e</sup> plantation. This bigger ship
      made a great viage of good drie fish, the which, if they had gone to a
      market w<sup>th</sup>, would have yeelded them (as such fish was sould y<sup>t</sup>
      season) 1800<sup>li</sup>. which would have enriched them. But because
      ther was a bruite of warr with France, y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>.
      neglected (through timerousnes) his order, and put first into Plimoth,
      &amp; after into Portsmouth, and so lost their opportunitie, and came by
      the loss. The lesser ship had as ill success, though she was as hopfull as
      y<sup>e</sup> other for y<sup>e</sup> marchants profite; for they had fild
      her with goodly cor-fish taken upon y<sup>e</sup> banke, as full as she
      could swime; and besids she had some 800<sup>li</sup>. weaight of beaver,
      besids other furrs to a good value from y<sup>e</sup> plantation. The m<sup>r</sup>.
      seeing so much goods come, put it abord y<sup>e</sup> biger ship, for more
      saftie; but M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow (their factor in this busines) was
      bound in a bond of 500<sup>li</sup>. to send it to London in y<sup>e</sup>
      smale ship; ther was some contending between y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>,
      &amp; him aboute it. But he tould y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>. he would
      follow his order aboute it; if he would take it out afterward, it should
      be at his perill. So it went in y<sup>e</sup> smale ship, and he sent
      bills of lading in both. The m<sup>r</sup>. was so carfull being both so
      well laden, as they went joyfully home togeather, for he towed y<sup>e</sup>
      leser ship at his sterne all y<sup>e</sup> way over bound, and they had
      such fayr weather as he never cast her of till they were shott deep in to
      y<sup>e</sup> English Chanell, almost within y<sup>e</sup> sight of
      Plimoth; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>and
      yet ther she was unhaply taken by a Turks man of warr, and carried into
      Saly, wher y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>. and men were made slaves, and many
      of y<sup>e</sup> beaver skins were sould for 4<sup>d</sup>. a peece. [138]
      Thus was all their hops dasht, and the joyfull news they ment to cary home
      turned to heavie tidings. Some thought this a hand of God for their too
      great exaction of y<sup>e</sup> poore plantation, but Gods judgments are
      unseerchable, neither dare I be bould therwith: but however it shows us y<sup>e</sup>
      uncertainty of all humane things, and what litle cause ther is of joying
      in them or trusting to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In y<sup>e</sup> bigger of these ships was sent over Captine Standish from
      y<sup>e</sup> plantation, w<sup>th</sup> leters &amp; instructions, both
      to their freinds of y<sup>e</sup> company which still clave to them, and
      also to y<sup>e</sup> Honourable Counsell of New-England. To y<sup>e</sup>
      company to desire y<sup>t</sup> seeing that they ment only to let them
      have goods upon sale, that they might have them upon easier termes, for
      they should never be able to bear such high intrest, or to allow so much
      per cent; also that what they would doe in y<sup>t</sup> way that it might
      be disburst in money, or such goods as were fitte and needfull for them,
      &amp; bought at best hand; and to aquainte them with y<sup>e</sup>
      contents of his leters to y<sup>e</sup> Counsell above said, which was to
      this purpose, to desire their favour &amp; help; that such of y<sup>e</sup>
      adventurers as had thus forsaken &amp; deserted them, might be brought to
      some order, and not to keepe them bound, and them selves be free. But that
      they might either stand to ther former <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>covenants, or ells come to
      some faire end, by dividente, or composition. But he came in a very bad
      time, for y<sup>e</sup> Stat was full of trouble, and y<sup>e</sup> plague
      very hote in London, so as no bussines could be done; yet he spake with
      some of y<sup>e</sup> Honourd Counsell, who promised all helpfullnes to y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation which lay in them. And sundrie of their freinds y<sup>e</sup>
      adventurers were so weakened with their losses y<sup>e</sup> last year, by
      y<sup>e</sup> losse of y<sup>e</sup> ship taken by the Turks, and y<sup>e</sup>
      loss of their fish, w<sup>ch</sup> by reason of y<sup>e</sup> warrs they
      were forcte to land at Portsmouth, and so came to litle; so as, though
      their wills were good, yet they<sup>r</sup> power was litle. And ther dyed
      such multituds weekly of y<sup>e</sup> plague, as all trade was dead, and
      litle money stirring. Yet with much adooe he tooke up 150<sup>li</sup>. (&amp;
      spent a good deal of it in expences) at 50. per cent, which he bestowed in
      trading goods &amp; such other most needfull comodities as he knew
      requiset for their use; and so returned passenger in a fhishing ship,
      haveing prepared a good way for y<sup>e</sup> compossition that was
      afterward made.
    </p>
    <p>
      In y<sup>e</sup> mean time it pleased y<sup>e</sup> Lord to give y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation peace and health and contented minds, and so to blese ther
      labours, as they had corne sufficient, (and some to spare to others,) with
      other foode; neither ever had they any supply of foode but what they first
      brought with them. After harvest this year, they sende out a boats load of
      corne 40. or 50. leagues to y<sup>e</sup> eastward, up a river called
      Kenibeck; it being one of those <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247"
      id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>2. shalops which their carpenter had built
      them y<sup>e</sup> year before; for bigger vessell had they none. They had
      laid a litle deck over her midships to keepe y<sup>e</sup> corne drie, but
      y<sup>e</sup> men were faine to stand it out all weathers without shelter;
      and y<sup>t</sup> time [139] of y<sup>e</sup> year begins to growe
      tempestious. But God preserved them, and gave them good success, for they
      brought home 700<sup>li</sup>. of beaver, besids some other furrs, having
      litle or nothing els but this corne, which them selves had raised out of y<sup>e</sup>
      earth. This viage was made by M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow &amp; some of y<sup>e</sup>
      old standards,<a name="FNanchor_CA_79" id="FNanchor_CA_79"></a><a

      About y<sup>e</sup> begining of Aprill they heard of Captain Standish his

        he taught us twise. And so y<sup>e</sup> weeke after grew weaker, every
        day more then other; yet he felt no paine but weaknes all y<sup>e</sup>
        time of his sicknes. The phisick he tooke wrought kindly in mans
        judgmente, but he grew weaker every day, feeling litle or no paine, and
        sensible to y<sup>e</sup> very last. He fell sicke y<sup>e</sup> 22. of
        Feb: and departed this life y<sup>e</sup> 1. of March. He had a
        continuall inwarde ague, but free from infection, so y<sup>t</sup> all
        his freinds came freely to him. And if either prayers, tears, or means,
        would have saved his life, he had not gone hence. But he having

      Thus these too great princes, and their pastor, left this world near
      aboute one time. Death maks no difference.

      He further brought them notice of y<sup>e</sup> death of their anciente
      friend, Mr. Cush-man, whom y<sup>e</sup> Lord tooke away allso this year,
      &amp; aboute this time, who was as their right hand with their freinds y<sup>e</sup>
      adventurers, and for diverce years had done &amp; agitated all their
      bussines with them to ther great advantage. He had write to y<sup>e</sup>
      Gove<sup>r</sup> but some few months before, of y<sup>e</sup> sore sicknes
      of M<sup>r</sup>. James Sherley, who was a cheefe friend to y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation, and lay at y<sup>e</sup> pointe of death, declaring his love
      &amp; helpfullnes, in all things; and much bemoned the loss they should
      have of him, if God should now take him away, as being y<sup>e</sup> stay
      &amp; life of y<sup>e</sup> whole bussines. As allso his owne purposs this
      year to come over, and spend his days with them. But he that thus write of
      anothers sicknes, knew not y<sup>t</sup> his owne death was so near. It
      shows allso that a m&#257;s ways are not in his owne power, but in his
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>hands
      who hath y<sup>e</sup> issues of life and death. Man may purpose, but God
      doth dispose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their other freinds from Leyden writ many leters to them full of sad
      laments for ther heavie loss; and though their wills were good to come to
      them, yet they saw no probabilitie of means, how it might be effected, but
      concluded (as it were) that all their hopes were cutt of; and many, being
      aged, begane to drop away by death.

      All which things (before related) being well weighed and laied togither,
      it could not but strick them with great perplexitie; and to looke humanly
      on y<sup>e</sup> state of things as they presented them selves at this
      time, it is a marvell it did not wholy discourage them, and sinck them.
      But they gathered up their spirits, and y<sup>e</sup> Lord so helped them,
      whose worke they had in hand, as now when they were at lowest<a
      name="FNanchor_CB_80" id="FNanchor_CB_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_CB_80"
      class="fnanchor">[CB]</a> they begane to rise againe, and being striped
      (in a maner) of all humane helps and hops, he brought things aboute other
      wise, in his devine providence, as they were not only upheld &amp;
      sustained, but their proceedings both honoured and imitated by others; as
      by y<sup>e</sup> sequell will more appeare, if y<sup>e</sup> Lord spare me
      life &amp; time to declare y<sup>e</sup> same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haveing now no fishing busines, or other things to intend, but only their
      trading &amp; planting, they sett them selves to follow the same with y<sup>e</sup>
      best industrie they could. The planters finding their corne, what they
      could spare from ther necessities, to be a com&#773;oditie, (for they
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>sould
      it at 6<sup>s</sup>. a bushell,) used great dilligence in planting y<sup>e</sup>
      same. And y<sup>e</sup> Gove<sup>r</sup> and such as were designed to
      manage the trade, (for it was retained for y<sup>e</sup> generall good,
      [141] and none were to trade in perticuler,) they followed it to the best
      advantage they could; and wanting trading goods, they understoode that a
      plantation which was at Monhigen, &amp; belonged to some marchants of
      Plimoth was to breake up, and diverse usefull goods was ther to be sould;
      the Gove<sup>r</sup> and M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow tooke a boat and some
      hands and went thither. But M<sup>r</sup>. David Thomson, who lived at
      Pascataway, understanding their purpose, tooke oppertunitie to goe with
      them, which was some hinderance to them both; for they, perceiveing their
      joynte desires to buy, held their goods at higher rates; and not only so,
      but would not sell a parcell of their trading goods, excepte they sould
      all. So, lest they should further prejudice one an other, they agreed to
      buy all, &amp; devid them equally between them. They bought allso a
      parcell of goats, which they distributed at home as they saw neede &amp;
      occasion, and tooke corne for them of y<sup>e</sup> people, which gave
      them good content. Their moyety of y<sup>e</sup> goods came to above 400<sup>li</sup>.
      starling. Ther was allso that spring a French ship cast away at
      Sacadahock, in w<sup>ch</sup> were many Biscaie ruggs &amp; other com&#773;odities,
      which were falen into these mens hands, &amp; some other fisher men at
      Damerins-cove, which were allso bought in partnership, and made their
      parte arise to above 500<sup>li</sup>. This they made shift to pay for,
      for y<sup>e</sup> most <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252"
      id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>part, with y<sup>e</sup> beaver &amp;
      comodities they had gott y<sup>e</sup> winter before, &amp; what they had
      gathered up y<sup>t</sup> somer. M<sup>r</sup>. Thomson having some thing
      overcharged him selfe, desired they would take some of his, but they
      refused except he would let them have his French goods only; and y<sup>e</sup>
      marchant (who was one of Bristol) would take their bill for to be paid y<sup>e</sup>
      next year. They were both willing, so they became ingaged for them &amp;
      tooke them. By which means they became very well furnished for trade; and
      tooke of therby some other ingagments w<sup>ch</sup> lay upon them, as the
      money taken up by Captaine Standish, and y<sup>e</sup> remains of former
      debts. With these goods, and their corne after harvest, they gott good
      store of trade, so as they were enabled to pay their ingagements against y<sup>e</sup>
      time, &amp; to get some cloathing for y<sup>e</sup> people, and had some
      comodities before hand. But now they begane to be envied, and others wente
      and fild y<sup>e</sup> Indeans with corne, and beat downe y<sup>e</sup>
      prise, giveing them twise as much as they had done, and under traded them
      in other comodities allso.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year they sent M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton into England, and gave him
      order to make a composition with y<sup>e</sup> adventurers, upon as good
      termes as he could (unto which some way had ben made y<sup>e</sup> year
      before by Captaine Standish); but yet injoyned him not to conclud
      absolutly till they knew y<sup>e</sup> termes, and had well considered of
      them; but to drive it to as good an issew as he could, and referr y<sup>e</sup>
      conclusion to them. Also they gave him a com&#773;ission <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>under
      their hands &amp; seals to take up some money, provided it exeeded not
      such a sum&#773;e specified, for which they engaged them selves, and gave
      him order how to lay out y<sup>e</sup> same for y<sup>e</sup> use of y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finding they ran&#773;e a great hazard to goe so long viages in a
      smale open boat, espetialy y<sup>e</sup> winter season, they begane to
      thinke how they might gett a small pinass; as for y<sup>e</sup> reason
      afforesaid, so also because others had raised y<sup>e</sup> prise with y<sup>e</sup>
      Indeans above y<sup>e</sup> halfe of what they had formerly given, so as
      in such a boat they could not [143<a name="FNanchor_CC_81"
      id="FNanchor_CC_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_CC_81" class="fnanchor">[CC]</a>]
      carry a quantity sufficient to answer their ends. They had no
      ship-carpenter amongst them, neither knew how to get one at presente; but
      they having an ingenious man that was a house carpenter, who also had
      wrought with y<sup>e</sup> ship carpenter (that was dead) when he built
      their boats, at their request he put forth him selfe to make a triall that
      way of his skill; and tooke one of y<sup>e</sup> bigest of ther shalops
      and sawed her in y<sup>e</sup> midle, and so lenthened her some 5. or 6.
      foote, and strengthened her with timbers, and so builte her up, and laid a
      deck on her; and so made her a conveniente and wholsome vessell, very fitt
      &amp; comfortable for their use, which did them servise 7. years after;
      and they gott her finished, and fitted with sayles &amp; anchors, y<sup>e</sup>
      insuing year. And thus passed y<sup>e</sup> affairs of this year. <span

      At y<sup>e</sup> usuall season of y<sup>e</sup> coming of ships M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton returned, and brought some usfull goods with him, according to y<sup>e</sup>

      This agreemente was very well liked of, &amp; approved by all y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation, and consented unto; though they knew not well how to raise y<sup>e</sup>
      payment, and discharge their other ingagements, and supply the yearly
      wants of y<sup>e</sup> plantation, seeing they were forced for their
      necessities to take up money or goods at so high intrests. Yet they
      undertooke it, and 7. or 8. of y<sup>e</sup> cheefe of y<sup>e</sup> place
      became joyntly bound for y<sup>e</sup> paimente of this 1800<sup>li</sup>.
      (in y<sup>e</sup> behalfe of y<sup>e</sup> rest) at y<sup>e</sup> severall
      days. In which they rane a great adventure, as their present state stood,
      having many other heavie burthens allready upon them, and all things in an
      uncertaine condition amongst them. So y<sup>e</sup> next returne it was
      absolutly confirmed on both sids, and y<sup>e</sup> bargen fairly
      ingrossed in partchmente and in many things put into better forme, by y<sup>e</sup>
      advice of y<sup>e</sup> learnedest counsell they could gett; and least any
      forfeiture should fall on y<sup>e</sup> whole for none paimente at any of
      y<sup>e</sup> days, it rane thus: to forfite 30<sup>s</sup>. a weeke if
      they missed y<sup>e</sup> time; and was concluded under their hands &amp;
      seals, as may be seen at large by y<sup>e</sup> deed it selfe.
    </p>
    <p>
      [145] Now though they had some untowarde persons mixed amongst them from
      the first, which came out of England, and more afterwards by some of y<sup>e</sup>
      adventurers, as freindship or other affections led them,&mdash;though
      sundrie were gone, some for Virginia, and some to other places,&mdash;yet
      diverse were still mingled amongst them, about whom y<sup>e</sup> Gove<sup>r</sup>
      &amp; counsell with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>other
      of their cheefe freinds had serious consideration, how to setle things in
      regard of this new bargen or purchas made, in respecte of y<sup>e</sup>
      distribution of things both for y<sup>e</sup> presente and future. For y<sup>e</sup>
      present, excepte peace and union were preserved, they should be able to
      doe nothing, but indanger to over throw all, now that other tyes &amp;
      bonds were taken away. Therfore they resolved, for sundrie reasons, to
      take in all amongst them, that were either heads of families, or single
      yonge men, that were of abillity, and free, (and able to governe them
      selvs with meete descretion, and their affairs, so as to be helpfull in y<sup>e</sup>
      comone-welth,) into this partnership or purchass. First, y<sup>ey</sup>
      considered that they had need of men &amp; strength both for defence and
      carrying on of bussinesses. 2<sup>ly</sup>, most of them had borne ther
      parts in former miseries &amp; wants with them, and therfore (in some
      sort) but equall to partake in a better condition, if y<sup>e</sup> Lord
      be pleased to give it. But cheefly they saw not how peace would be
      preserved without so doing, but danger &amp; great disturbance might grow
      to their great hurte &amp; prejudice other wise. Yet they resolved to keep
      such a mean in distribution of lands, and other courses, as should not
      hinder their growth in others coming to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they caled y<sup>e</sup> company togeather, and conferred with them,
      and came to this conclusion, that y<sup>e</sup> trade should be managed as
      before, to help to pay the debts; and all such persons as were above named
      should be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>reputed
      and inrouled for purchasers; single free men to have a single share, and
      every father of a familie to be alowed to purchass so many shares as he
      had persons in his family; that is to say, one for him selfe, and one for
      his wife, and for every child that he had living with him, one. As for
      servants, they had none, but what either their maisters should give them
      out of theirs, or their deservings should obtaine from y<sup>e</sup>
      company afterwards. Thus all were to be cast into single shares according
      to the order abovesaid; and so every one was to pay his part according to
      his proportion towards y<sup>e</sup> purchass, &amp; all other debts, what
      y<sup>e</sup> profite of y<sup>e</sup> trade would not reach too; viz. a
      single man for a single share, a maister of a famalie for so many as he
      had. This gave all good contente. And first accordingly the few catle
      which they had were devided, which arose to this proportion; a cowe to 6.
      persons or shars, &amp; 2. goats to y<sup>e</sup> same, which were first
      equalised for age &amp; goodnes, and then lotted for; single persons
      consorting with others, as they thought good, &amp; smaler familys
      likwise; and swine though more [146] in number, yet by y<sup>e</sup> same
      rule. Then they agreed that every person or share should have 20. acres of
      land devided unto them, besids y<sup>e</sup> single acres they had
      allready; and they appoynted were to begin first on y<sup>e</sup> one side
      of y<sup>e</sup> towne, &amp; how farr to goe; and then on y<sup>e</sup>
      other side in like maner; and so to devid it by lotte; and appointed
      sundrie by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>name
      to doe it, and tyed them to certaine ruls to proceed by; as that they
      should only lay out settable or tillable land, at least such of it as
      should butt on y<sup>e</sup> water side, (as y<sup>e</sup> most they were
      to lay out did,) and pass by y<sup>e</sup> rest as refuse and com&#773;une;
      and what they judged fitte should be so taken. And they were first to
      agree of y<sup>e</sup> goodnes &amp; fitnes of it before the lott was
      drawne, and so it might as well prove some of ther owne, as an other mans;
      and this course they were to hould throwout. But yet seekeing to keepe y<sup>e</sup>
      people togither, as much as might be, they allso agreed upon this order,
      by mutuall consente, before any lots were cast: that whose lotts soever
      should fall next y<sup>e</sup> towne, or most conveninte for nearnes, they
      should take to them a neigboure or tow, whom they best liked; and should
      suffer them to plant corne with them for 4. years; and afterwards they
      might use as much of theirs for as long time, if they would. Allso every
      share or 20. acers was to be laid out 5. acres in breadth by y<sup>e</sup>
      water side, and 4. acres in lenght, excepting nooks &amp; corners, which
      were to be measured as y<sup>ey</sup> would bear to best advantage. But no
      meadows were to be laid out at all, nor were not of many years after,
      because they were but streight of meadow grounds; and if they had bene now
      given out, it would have hindred all addition to them afterwards; but
      every season all were appoynted wher they should mowe, according to y<sup>e</sup>
      proportion of catle they had. This <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261"
      id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>distribution gave generally good contente,
      and setled mens minds. Also they gave y<sup>e</sup> Gove<sup>r</sup> &amp;
      4. or 5. of y<sup>e</sup> spetiall men amongst them, y<sup>e</sup> houses
      they lived in; y<sup>e</sup> rest were valued &amp; equalised at an
      indiferent rate, and so every man kept his owne, and he that had a better
      alowed some thing to him that had a worse, as y<sup>e</sup> valuation
      wente.

      Ther is one thing that fell out in y<sup>e</sup> begining of y<sup>e</sup>
      winter before, which I have refferred to this place, that I may handle y<sup>e</sup>
      whole matter togeither. Ther was a ship, with many passengers in her and
      sundrie goods, bound for Virginia. They had lost them selves at sea,
      either by y<sup>e</sup> insufficiencie of y<sup>e</sup> maister, or his
      ilnes; for he was sick &amp; lame of y<sup>e</sup> scurvie, so that he
      could but lye in y<sup>e</sup> cabin dore, &amp; give direction; and it
      should seeme was badly assisted either w<sup>th</sup> mate or mariners; or
      else y<sup>e</sup> fear and unrulines of y<sup>e</sup> passengers were
      such, as they made them stear a course betweene y<sup>e</sup> southwest
      &amp; y<sup>e</sup> norwest, that they might fall with some land, what
      soever it was they cared not. For they had been 6. weeks at sea, and had
      no water, nor beere, nor any woode left, but had burnt up all their emptie
      caske; only one of y<sup>e</sup> company had a hogshead of wine or 2.
      which was allso allmost spente, so as they feared they should be starved
      at sea, or consumed with diseases, which made them rune this desperate
      course. But it plased God that though they came so neare y<sup>e</sup>
      shoulds of Cap-Codd [147] or else ran stumbling over them in <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup>
      night, they knew not how, they came right before a small blind harbore,
      that lyes about y<sup>e</sup> midle of Manamoyake Bay, to y<sup>e</sup>
      southward of Cap-Codd, with a small gale of wind; and about highwater
      toucht upon a barr of sand that lyes before it, but had no hurte, y<sup>e</sup>
      sea being smoth; so they laid out an anchore. But towards the evening the
      wind sprunge up at sea, and was so rough, as broake their cable, &amp;
      beat them over the barr into y<sup>e</sup> harbor, wher they saved their
      lives &amp; goods, though much were hurte with salt water; for w<sup>th</sup>
      beating they had sprung y<sup>e</sup> but end of a planke or too, &amp;
      beat out ther occome; but they were soone over, and ran on a drie flate
      within the harbor, close by a beach; so at low water they gatt out their
      goods on drie shore, and dried those that were wette, and saved most of
      their things without any great loss; neither was y<sup>e</sup> ship much
      hurt, but shee might be mended, and made servisable againe. But though
      they were not a litle glad that they had thus saved their lives, yet when
      they had a litle refreshed them selves, and begane to thinke on their
      condition, not knowing wher they were, nor what they should doe, they
      begane to be strucken with sadnes. But shortly after they saw some Indians
      come to them in canows, which made them stand upon their gard. But when
      they heard some of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans speake English unto them, they
      were not a litle revived, especially when they heard them demand if they
      were the Gove<sup>r</sup> of Plimoths men, or freinds; <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>and y<sup>t</sup>
      they would bring them to y<sup>e</sup> English houses, or carry their
      letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      They feasted these Indeans, and gave them many giftes; and sente 2. men
      and a letter with them to y<sup>e</sup> Gove<sup>r</sup>, and did intreat
      him to send a boat unto them, with some pitch, and occume, and spiks, w<sup>th</sup>
      divers other necessaries for y<sup>e</sup> mending of ther ship (which was
      recoverable). Allso they besought him to help them with some corne and
      sundrie other things they wanted, to enable them to make their viage to
      Virginia; and they should be much bound to him, and would make
      satisfaction for any thing they had, in any comodities they had abord.
      After y<sup>e</sup> Gove<sup>r</sup> was well informed by y<sup>e</sup>
      messengers of their condition, he caused a boate to be made ready, and
      such things to be provided as they write for; and because others were
      abroad upon trading, and such other affairs, as had been fitte to send
      unto them, he went him selfe, and allso carried some trading comodities,
      to buy them corne of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans. It was no season of y<sup>e</sup>
      year to goe withoute y<sup>e</sup> Cape, but understanding wher y<sup>e</sup>
      ship lay, he went into y<sup>e</sup> bottom of y<sup>e</sup> bay, on y<sup>e</sup>
      inside, and put into a crick called Naumskachett, wher it is not much
      above 2. mile over [148] land to y<sup>e</sup> bay wher they were, wher he
      had y<sup>e</sup> Indeans ready to cary over any thing to them. Of his
      arrivall they were very glad, and received the things to mend ther ship,
      and other necessaries. Allso he bought them as much corne as they would
      have; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>and
      wheras some of their sea-men were rune away amonge the Indeans, he
      procured their returne to y<sup>e</sup> ship, and so left them well
      furnished and contented, being very thankfull for y<sup>e</sup> curtesies
      they receaved. But after the Governor thus left them, he went into some
      other harbors ther aboute and loaded his boat with corne, which he traded,
      and so went home. But he had not been at home many days, but he had notice
      from them, that by the violence of a great storme, and y<sup>e</sup> bad
      morring of their ship (after she was mended) she was put a shore, and so
      beatten and shaken as she was now wholy unfitte to goe to sea. And so
      their request was that they might have leave to repaire to them, and
      soujourne with them, till they could have means to convey them selves to
      Virginia; and that they might have means to tr&#257;sport their goods, and
      they would pay for y<sup>e</sup> same, or any thing els wher with y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation should releeve them. Considering their distres, their requests
      were granted, and all helpfullnes done unto them; their goods transported,
      and them selves &amp; goods sheltered in their houses as well as they
      could.

    <p>
      The cheefe amongst these people was one M<sup>r</sup>. Fells and M<sup>r</sup>.
      Sibsie, which had many servants belonging unto them, many of them being
      Irish. Some others ther were y<sup>t</sup> had a servante or 2. a peece;
      but y<sup>e</sup> most were servants, and such as were ingaged to the
      former persons, who allso had y<sup>e</sup> most goods. Affter they were
      hither come, and some thing setled, the maisters <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>desired some ground to
      imploye ther servants upon; seing it was like to be y<sup>e</sup> latter
      end of y<sup>e</sup> year before they could have passage for Virginia, and
      they had now y<sup>e</sup> winter before them; they might clear some
      ground, and plant a crope (seeing they had tools, &amp; necessaries for y<sup>e</sup>
      same) to help to bear their charge, and keep their servants in imployment;
      and if they had opportunitie to departe before the same was ripe, they
      would sell it on y<sup>e</sup> ground. So they had ground appointed them
      in convenient places, and Fells &amp; some other of them raised a great
      deall of corne, which they sould at their departure. This Fells, amongst
      his other servants, had a maid servante which kept his house &amp; did his
      household affairs, and by the intimation of some that belonged unto him,
      he was suspected to keep her, as his concubine; and both of them were
      examined ther upon, but nothing could be proved, and they stood upon their
      justification; so with admonition they were dismiste. But afterward it
      appeard she was with child, so he gott a small boat, &amp; ran away with
      her, for fear of punishmente. First he went to Cap-Anne, and after into y<sup>e</sup>
      bay of y<sup>e</sup> Massachussets, but could get no passage, and had like
      to have been cast away; and was forst to come againe and submite him
      selfe; but they pact him away &amp; those that belonged unto him by the
      first oppertunitie, and dismiste all the rest as soone as could, being
      many untoward people amongst them; though ther were allso some that caried
      them selves <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>very
      orderly all y<sup>e</sup> time they stayed. And the [149] plantation had
      some benefite by them, in selling them corne &amp; other provisions of
      food for cloathing; for they had of diverse kinds, as cloath, perpetuanes,
      &amp; other stuffs, besids hose, &amp; shoes, and such like com&#773;odities
      as y<sup>e</sup> planters stood in need of. So they both did good, and
      received good one from another; and a cuple of barks caried them away at y<sup>e</sup>
      later end of som&#773;er. And sundrie of them have acknowledged their
      thankfullnes since from Virginia.
    </p>
    <p>
      That they might y<sup>e</sup> better take all convenient opportunitie to
      follow their trade, both to maintaine them selves, and to disingage them
      of those great sumes which they stood charged with, and bound for, they
      resoloved to build a smale pinass at Manamet, a place 20. mile from y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation, standing on y<sup>e</sup> sea to y<sup>e</sup> southward of
      them, unto which, by an other creeke on this side, they could cary their
      goods, within 4. or 5. miles, and then tr&#257;sport them over land to
      their vessell; and so avoyd the compasing of Cap-Codd, and those
      deangerous shoulds, and so make any vioage to y<sup>e</sup> southward in
      much shorter time, and with farr less danger. Also for y<sup>e</sup>
      saftie of their vessell &amp; goods, they builte a house their, and kept
      some servants, who also planted corne, and reared some swine, and were
      allwayes ready to goe out with y<sup>e</sup> barke when ther was occasion.
      All which tooke good effecte, and turned to their profite.

      They now sent (with y<sup>e</sup> returne of y<sup>e</sup> ships) M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton againe into England, giveing him full power, under their hands
      &amp; seals, to conclude the former bargaine with y<sup>e</sup>
      adventurers; and sent ther bonds for y<sup>e</sup> paimente of the money.
      Allso they sent what beaver they could spare to pay some of their
      ingagementes, &amp; to defray his chargs; for those deepe interests still
      kepte them low. Also he had order to procure a patente for a fitt trading
      place in y<sup>e</sup> river of Kenebec; for being emulated both by the
      planters at Pascataway &amp;, other places to y<sup>e</sup> eastward of
      them, and allso by y<sup>e</sup> fishing ships, which used to draw much
      profite from y<sup>e</sup> Indeans of those parts, they threatened to
      procure a grante, &amp; shutte them out from thence; espetially after they
      saw them so well furnished with com&#773;odities, as to carie the trade
      from them. They thought it but needfull to prevente such a thing, at least
      that they might not be excluded from free trade ther, wher them selves had
      first begune and discovered the same, &#257;d brought it to so good
      effecte. This year allso they had letters, and messengers from y<sup>e</sup>
      Dutch-plantation, sent unto them from y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> ther,
      writen both in Dutch &amp; French. The Dutch had traded in these southerne
      parts, diverse years before they came; but they begane no plantation hear
      till 4. or 5. years after their coming, and here begining. Ther letters
      were as followeth. It being their maner to be full of complementall

        [150] We have often before this wished for an opportunitie or an
        occasion to congratulate you, and your prosperous and praise-worthy
        undertakeings, and Government of your colony ther. And the more, in that
        we also have made a good begining to pitch y<sup>e</sup> foundation of a
        collonie hear; and seeing our native countrie lyes not farr from yours,
        and our forefathers (diverse hundred years agoe) have made and held
        frendship and alliance with your ancestours, as sufficently appears by y<sup>e</sup>
        old contractes, and entrecourses, confirmed under y<sup>e</sup> hands of
        kings &amp; princes, in y<sup>e</sup> pointe of warr &amp; trafick; as
        may be seene and read by all y<sup>e</sup> world in y<sup>e</sup> old
        chronakles. The which are not only by the king now reigning confirmed,
        but it hath pleased his majesty, upon mature deliberation, to make a new
        covenante, (and to take up armes,) with y<sup>e</sup> States Generall of
        our dear native country, against our commone enemie the Spaniards, who
        seeke nothing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>else
        but to usurpe and overcome other Christian kings and princes lands, that
        so he might obtaine and possess his pretended monarchic over all
        Christendom; and so to rule and com&#773;and, after his owne pleasure,
        over y<sup>e</sup> consciences of so many hundred thousand sowles, which
        God forbid.
      </p>
      <p>
        And also seeing it hath some time since been reported unto us, by some
        of our people, that by occasion came so farr northward with their
        shalop, and met with sundry of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, who tould them
        that they were within halfe a days journey of your plantation, and
        offered ther service to cary letters unto you; therfore we could not
        forbear to salute you with these few lines, with presentation of our
        good will and servise unto you, in all frendly-kindnes &amp;

        Now these are further to give your Wor<sup>pps</sup> to understand, that

      After this ther was many passages betweene them both by letters and other
      entercourse; and they had some profitable commerce togither for diverce
      years, till other occasions interrupted y<sup>e</sup> same, as may happily
      appear afterwards, more at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they sent M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton away for England this year, y<sup>e</sup>
      Gove<sup>r</sup> and some of their cheefe freinds had serious
      consideration, not only how they might discharge those great ingagments
      which lay so heavily upon them, as is affore mentioned, but also how they
      might (if possiblie they could) devise means to help some of their freinds
      and breethren of Leyden over unto them, who <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>desired so much to come to
      them, &#257;d they desired as much their company. To effecte which, they
      resolved to rune a high course, and of great adventure, not knowing
      otherwise how to bring it aboute. Which was to hire y<sup>e</sup> trade of
      y<sup>e</sup> company for certaine years, and in that time to undertake to
      pay that 1800<sup>li</sup>. and all y<sup>e</sup> rest of y<sup>e</sup>
      debts that then lay upon y<sup>e</sup> plantation, which was aboute some
      600<sup>li</sup>. more; and so to set them free, and returne the trade to
      y<sup>e</sup> generalitie againe at y<sup>e</sup> end of y<sup>e</sup>
      terme. Upon which resolution they called y<sup>e</sup> company togeither,
      and made it clearly appear unto all what their debts were, and upon what
      terms they would undertake to pay them all in such a time, and sett them
      clear. But their other ends they were faine to keepe secrete, haveing only
      privatly acquaynted some of their trusty freinds therwith; which were glad
      of y<sup>e</sup> same, but doubted how they would be able to performe it.
      So after some agitation of the thing w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> company,

        shuch others as they shall thinke good to take as partners and
        undertakers with them, concerning the trade for beaver &amp; other furrs
        &amp; comodities, &amp;c.; made July, 1627.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, it is agreed and covenanted betweexte y<sup>e</sup> said parties,
        that y<sup>e</sup> afforsaid William Bradford, Captain Myl <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>Standish,
        &amp; Isaack Allerton, &amp;c. have undertaken, and doe by these
        presents, covenante and agree to pay, discharge, and acquite y<sup>e</sup>
        said collony of all y<sup>e</sup> debtes both due for y<sup>e</sup>
        purchass, or any other belonging to them, at y<sup>e</sup> day of y<sup>e</sup>
        date of these presents.
      </p>
      <p>
        [153] Secondly, y<sup>e</sup> above-said parties are to have and freely
        injoye y<sup>e</sup> pinass latly builte, the boat at Manamett, and y<sup>e</sup>
        shalop, called y<sup>e</sup> Bass-boat, with all other implements to
        them belonging, that is in y<sup>e</sup> store of y<sup>e</sup> said
        company; with all y<sup>e</sup> whole stock of furrs, fells, beads,
        corne, wampampeak, hatchets, knives, &amp;c. that is now in y<sup>e</sup>
        storre, or any way due unto y<sup>e</sup> same uppon accounte.
      </p>
      <p>
        3<sup>ly</sup>. That y<sup>e</sup> above said parties have y<sup>e</sup>
        whole trade to them selves, their heires and assignes, with all y<sup>e</sup>
        privileges therof, as y<sup>e</sup> said collonie doth now, or may use
        the same, for 6. full years, to begine y<sup>e</sup> last of September
        next insuing.
      </p>
      <p>
        4<sup>ly</sup>. In furder consideration of y<sup>e</sup> discharge of y<sup>e</sup>
        said debtes, every severall purchaser doth promise and covenante yearly
        to pay, or cause to be payed, to the above said parties, during y<sup>e</sup>
        full terme of y<sup>e</sup> said 6. years, 3. bushells of corne, or 6<sup>li</sup>.
        of tobaco, at y<sup>e</sup> undertakers choyse.
      </p>
      <p>
        5<sup>ly</sup>. The said undertakers shall dureing y<sup>e</sup>
        afforesaid terme bestow 50<sup>li</sup>. per annum, in hose and shoese,
        to be brought over for y<sup>e</sup> collonies use, to be sould unto
        them for corne at 6<sup>s</sup>. per bushell.
      </p>
      <p>
        6<sup>ly</sup>. That at y<sup>e</sup> end of y<sup>e</sup> said terme of
        6. years, the whole trade shall returne to y<sup>t</sup> use and
        benefite of y<sup>e</sup> said collonie, as before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, if y<sup>e</sup> afforesaid undertakers, after they have
        aquainted their freinds in England with these covenants, doe (upon y<sup>e</sup>
        first returne) resolve to performe them, and undertake to discharge y<sup>e</sup>
        debtes of y<sup>e</sup> said collony, according to y<sup>e</sup> true
        meaning &amp; intente of these presents, then they are (upon such notice
        given) to stand in full force; otherwise all things to <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>remaine
        as formerly they were, and a true accounte to be given to y<sup>e</sup>
        said collonie, of the disposing of all things according to the former
        order.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton carried a coppy of this agreemente with him into
      England, and amongst other his instructions had order given him to deale
      with some of their speciall freinds, to joyne with them in this trade upon
      y<sup>e</sup> above recited conditions; as allso to imparte their further
      ends that moved them to take this course, namly, the helping over of some
      of their freinds from Leyden, as they should be able; in which if any of
      them would joyne with them they should thankfully acceptt of their love
      and partnership herein. And with all (by their letters) gave them some
      grounds of their hops of the accomplishmente of these things with some
      advantage.

      After M<sup>r</sup>. Allertons arivall in England, he aquainted them with
      his comission and full power to conclude y<sup>e</sup> forementioned
      bargan &amp; purchas; upon [154] the veiw wherof, and y<sup>e</sup>
      delivery of y<sup>e</sup> bonds for y<sup>e</sup> paymente of y<sup>e</sup>
      money yearly, (as is before mentioned,) it was fully concluded, and a

      href="#Footnote_CF_84" class="fnanchor">[CF]</a> fairly ingrossed in

      the same. Morover he delte with them aboute other things according to his
      instructions. As <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>to
      admitt some of these their good freinds into this purchass if they
      pleased, and to deale with them for moneys at better rates, &amp;c.
      Touching which I shall hear inserte a letter of M<sup>r</sup>. Sherleys,
      giving light to what followed therof, writ to y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
      as followeth.
    </p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        S<sup>r</sup>: I have received yours of y<sup>e</sup> 26. of May by M<sup>r</sup>.
        Gibs, &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Goffe, with y<sup>e</sup> barrell of otter
        skins, according to y<sup>e</sup> contents; for which I got a bill of
        store, and so tooke them up, and sould them togeather at 78<sup>li</sup>.
        12<sup>s</sup>. sterling; and since, M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton hath
        received y<sup>e</sup> money, as will apear by the accounte. It is true
        (as you write) that your ingagments are great, not only the purchass,
        but you are yet necessitated to take up y<sup>e</sup> stock you work
        upon; and y<sup>t</sup> not at 6. or 8. p<sup>r</sup> cent. as it is
        here let out, but at 30. 40. yea, &amp; some at 50. p<sup>r</sup> cent.
        which, were not your gaines great, and Gods blessing on your honest
        indeaours more then ordinarie, it could not be y<sup>t</sup> you should
        longe subsiste in y<sup>e</sup> maintaining of, &amp; upholding of your
        worldly affaires. And this your honest &amp; discreete agente, M<sup>r</sup>.
        Allerton, hath seriously considered, &amp; deeply laid to mind, how to
        ease you of it. He tould me you were contented to accepte of me &amp;
        some few others, to joyne with you in y<sup>e</sup> purchass, as
        partners; for which I kindly thanke you and all y<sup>e</sup> rest, and
        doe willingly accepte of it. And though absente, shall willingly be at
        shuch charge as you &amp; y<sup>e</sup> rest shall thinke meete; and
        this year am contented to forbear my former 50<sup>li</sup>. and 2.
        years increase for y<sup>e</sup> venture, both which now makes it 80<sup>li</sup>.
        without any bargaine or condition for y<sup>e</sup> profite, you (I mean
        y<sup>e</sup> generalitie) stand to y<sup>e</sup> adventure, outward,
        and homeward. I have perswaded M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews and M<sup>r</sup>.
        Beachamp to doe y<sup>e</sup> like, so as you are eased of y<sup>e</sup>
        high rate, you were at y<sup>e</sup> other 2. yeares; I say we leave it
        freely to your selves <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276"
        id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>to alow us what you please, and as God
        shall blesse. What course I rune, M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp desireth to
        doe y<sup>e</sup> same; and though he have been or seemed somwhat harsh
        heretofore, yet now you shall find he is new moulded. I allso see by
        your letter, you desire I should be your agente or factore hear. I have
        ever found you so faithfull, honest, and upright men, as I have even
        resolved with my selfe (God assisting me) to doe you all y<sup>e</sup>
        good lyeth in my power; and therfore if you please to make choyse of so
        weak a man, both for abillities and body, to performe your bussines, I
        promise (y<sup>e</sup> Lord enabling me) to doe y<sup>e</sup> best I can
        according to those abillities he hath given me; and wherin I faile,
        blame your selves, y<sup>t</sup> you made no better choyce. Now, because
        I am sickly, and we are all mortall, I have advised M<sup>r</sup>.
        Allerton to joyne M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp with me in your deputation,
        which I conceive to be very necessary &amp; good for you; your charge
        shall be no more, for it is not your salarie maks me undertake your [156<a

      This was accordingly confirmed by the above named, and 4. more of the
      cheefe of them under their hands &amp; seals, and delivered unto them.
      Also M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton formerly had authoritie under their hands
      &amp; seals for y<sup>e</sup> transacting of y<sup>e</sup> former
      bussines, and taking up of moneys, &amp;c. which still he retained whilst
      he was imployed in these affaires; they mistrusting neither him nor any of
      their freinds faithfullnes, which made them more remisse in looking to
      shuch acts as had passed under their hands, as necessarie for y<sup>e</sup>
      time; but letting them rune on to long unminded or recaled, it turned to
      their harme afterwards, as will appere in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      [157] M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton having setled all things thus in a good and
      hopfull way, he made hast to returne in y<sup>e</sup> first of y<sup>e</sup>
      spring to be hear with their supply for trade, (for y<sup>e</sup>
      fishermen with whom he came used to sett forth in winter &amp; be here
      betimes.) He brought a resonable supply of goods for y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation, and without those great interests as before is noted; and
      brought an accounte of y<sup>e</sup> beaver sould, and how y<sup>e</sup>
      money was disposed for goods, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> paymente of other
      debtes, having paid all debts abroad to others, save to M<sup>r</sup>.
      Sherley, M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp, &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews; from whom
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>likwise
      he brought an accounte which to them all amounted not to above 400<sup>li</sup>.
      for which he had passed bonds. Allso he had payed the first paymente for y<sup>e</sup>
      purchass, being due for this year, viz. 200<sup>li</sup>. and brought them
      y<sup>e</sup> bonde for y<sup>e</sup> same canselled; so as they now had
      no more foreine debtes but y<sup>e</sup> abovesaid 400<sup>li</sup>. and
      odde pownds, and y<sup>e</sup> rest of y<sup>e</sup> yearly purchass
      monie. Some other debtes they had in y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie, but they were
      without any intrest, &amp; they had wherwith to discharge them when they
      were due. To this pass the Lord had brought things for them. Also he
      brought them further notice that their freinds, the abovenamed, &amp; some
      others that would joyne with them in y<sup>e</sup> trad &amp; purchass,
      did intend for to send over to Leyden, for a competente number of them, to
      be hear the next year without fayle, if y<sup>e</sup> Lord pleased to
      blesse their journey. He allso brought them a patente for Kenebeck, but it
      was so straite &amp; ill bounded, as they were faine to renew &amp;
      inlarge it the next year, as allso that which they had at home, to their
      great charge, as will after appeare. Hithertoo M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton did
      them good and faithfull service; and well had it been if he had so
      continued, or els they had now ceased for imploying him any longer thus
      into England. But of this more afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having procured a patente (as is above said) for Kenebeck, they now
      erected a house up above in y<sup>e</sup> river in y<sup>e</sup> most
      convenientest place for trade, as they <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>conceived, and furnished the
      same with com&#773;odities for y<sup>t</sup> end, both winter &amp; som&#773;er,
      not only with corne, but also with such other commodities as y<sup>e</sup>
      fishermen had traded with them, as coats, shirts, ruggs, &amp; blankets,
      biskett, pease, prunes, &amp;c.; and what they could not have out of
      England, they bought of the fishing ships, and so carried on their
      bussines as well as they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year the Dutch sent againe unto them from their plantation, both kind
      leterss, and also diverse comodities, as suger, linen cloth, Holand finer
      &amp; courser stufes, &amp;c. They came up with their barke to Manamete,
      to their house ther, in which came their Secretarie Rasier; who was
      accompanied with a noyse of trumpeters, and some other attendants; and
      desired that they would send a boat for him, for he could not travill so
      farr over land. So they sent a boat to Manonscussett, and brought him to y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation, with y<sup>e</sup> cheefe of his company. And after some few
      days entertainmente, he returned to his barke, and some of them wente with
      him, and bought sundry of his goods; after which begining thus made, they
      sente often times to y<sup>e</sup> same place, and had entercourse
      togeather for diverce years; and amongst other comodities, they vended
      [158] much tobaco for linen cloath, stuffs, &amp;c., which was a good
      benefite to y<sup>e</sup> people, till the Virginians found out their
      plantation. But that which turned most to their profite, in time, was an
      entrance into the trade of Wampampeake; for they <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>now bought aboute 50<sup>li</sup>.
      worth of it of them; and they tould them how vendable it was at their
      forte Orania; and did perswade them they would find it so at Kenebeck; and
      so it came to pass in time, though at first it stuck, &amp; it was 2.
      years before they could put of this small quantity, till y<sup>e</sup>
      inland people knew of it; and afterwards they could scarce ever gett
      enough for them, for many years togeather. And so this, with their other
      provissions, cutt of they trade quite from y<sup>e</sup> fisher-men, and
      in great part from other of y<sup>e</sup> stragling planters. And strange
      it was to see the great allteration it made in a few years amonge y<sup>e</sup>
      Indeans them selves; for all the Indeans of these parts, &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachussets, had none or very litle of it,<a name="FNanchor_CI_87"
      id="FNanchor_CI_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_CI_87" class="fnanchor">[CI]</a>
      but y<sup>e</sup> sachems &amp; some spetiall persons that wore a litle of
      it for ornamente. Only it was made &amp; kepte amonge y<sup>e</sup>
      Nariganssets, &amp; Pequents, which grew rich &amp; potent by it, and
      these people were poore &amp; begerly, and had no use of it. Neither did
      the English of this plantation, or any other in y<sup>e</sup> land, till
      now that they had knowledg of it from y<sup>e</sup> Dutch, so much as know
      what it was, much less y<sup>t</sup> it was a com&#773;oditie of that
      worth &amp; valew. But after it grue thus to be a comoditie in these
      parts, these Indeans fell into it allso, and to learne how to make it; for
      y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets doe geather y<sup>e</sup> shells of which y<sup>ey</sup>
      make it from their shors. And it hath now continued a current comoditie
      aboute this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>20.
      years, and it may prove a drugg in time. In y<sup>e</sup> mean time it
      maks y<sup>e</sup> Indeans of these parts rich &amp; power full and also
      prowd therby; and fills them with peeces, powder, and shote, which no laws
      can restraine, by reasone of y<sup>e</sup> bassnes of sundry unworthy
      persons, both English, Dutch, &amp; French, which may turne to y<sup>e</sup>
      ruine of many. Hithertoo y<sup>e</sup> Indeans of these parts had no
      peeces nor other armes but their bowes &amp; arrowes, nor of many years
      after; nether durst they scarce handle a gune, so much were they affraid
      of them; and y<sup>e</sup> very sight of one (though out of kilter) was a
      terrour unto them. But those Indeans to y<sup>e</sup> east parts, which
      had com&#773;erce with y<sup>e</sup> French, got peces of them, and they
      in the end made a commone trade of it; and in time our English fisher-men,
      led with y<sup>e</sup> like covetoussnes, followed their example, for
      their owne gaine; but upon complainte against them, it pleased the kings
      majestie to prohibite y<sup>e</sup> same by a stricte proclaimation,
      commanding that no sorte of armes, or munition, should by any of his
      subjects be traded with them.

    <p>
      Aboute some 3. or 4. years before this time, ther came over one Captaine
      Wolastone, (a man of pretie parts,) and with him 3. or 4. more of some
      eminencie, who brought with them a great many servants, with provissions
      &amp; other implments for to begine a plantation; and pitched them selves
      in a place within the Massachusets, which they called, after their
      Captains <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>name,
      Mount-Wollaston. Amongst whom was one M<sup>r</sup>. Morton, who, it
      should seeme, had some small adventure (of his owne or other mens) amongst
      them; but had litle respecte [159] amongst them, and was sleghted by y<sup>e</sup>
      meanest servants. Haveing continued ther some time, and not finding things
      to answer their expectations, nor profite to arise as they looked for,
      Captaine Wollaston takes a great part of y<sup>e</sup> sarvants, and
      transports them to Virginia, wher he puts them of at good rates, selling
      their time to other men; and writs back to one M<sup>r</sup>. Rassdall,
      one of his cheefe partners, and accounted their marchant, to bring another
      parte of them to Verginia likewise, intending to put them of ther as he
      had done y<sup>e</sup> rest. And he, w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> consente
      of y<sup>e</sup> said Rasdall, appoynted one Fitcher to be his
      Livetenante, and governe y<sup>e</sup> remaines of y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation, till he or Rasdall returned to take further order theraboute.
      But this Morton abovesaid, haveing more craft then honestie, (who had been
      a kind of petie-fogger, of Furnefells Inne,) in y<sup>e</sup> others
      absence, watches an oppertunitie, (commons being but hard amongst them,)
      and gott some strong drinck &amp; other junkats, &amp; made them a feast;
      and after they were merie, he begane to tell them, he would give them good
      counsell. You see (saith he) that many of your fellows are carried to
      Virginia; and if you stay till this Rasdall returne, you will also be
      carried away and sould for slaves with y<sup>e</sup> rest. Therfore I
      would <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>advise
      you to thruste out this Levetenant Fitcher; and I, having a parte in the
      plantation, will receive you as my partners and consociats; so may you be
      free from service, and we will converse, trad, plante, &amp; live
      togeather as equalls, &amp; supporte &amp; protecte one another, or to
      like effecte. This counsell was easily received; so they tooke
      oppertunitie, and thrust Levetenante Fitcher out a dores, and would suffer
      him to come no more amongst them, but forct him to seeke bread to eate,
      and other releefe from his neigbours, till he could gett passages for
      England. After this they fell to great licenciousnes, and led a dissolute
      life, powering out them selves into all profanenes. And Morton became lord
      of misrule, and maintained (as it were) a schoole of Athisme. And after
      they had gott some good into their hands, and gott much by trading with y<sup>e</sup>
      Indeans, they spent it as vainly, in quaffing &amp; drinking both wine
      &amp; strong waters in great exsess, and, as some reported, 10<sup>li</sup>.
      worth in a morning. They allso set up a May-pole, drinking and dancing
      aboute it many days togeather, inviting the Indean women, for their
      consorts, dancing and frisking togither, (like so many fairies, or furies
      rather,) and worse practises. As if they had anew revived &amp; celebrated
      the feasts of y<sup>e</sup> Roman Goddes Flora, or y<sup>e</sup> beasly
      practieses of y<sup>e</sup> madd Bacchinalians. Morton likwise (to shew
      his poetrie) composed sundry rimes &amp; verses, some tending to
      lasciviousnes, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>others
      to y<sup>e</sup> detraction &amp; scandall of some persons, which he
      affixed to this idle or idoll May-polle. They chainged allso the name of
      their place, and in stead of calling it Mounte Wollaston, they call it
      Merie-mounte, [160] as if this joylity would have lasted ever. But this
      continued not long, for after Morton was sent for England, (as follows to
      be declared,) shortly after came over that worthy gentlman, M<sup>r</sup>.
      John Indecott, who brought over a patent under y<sup>e</sup> broad seall,
      for y<sup>e</sup> govermente of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, who visiting
      those parts caused y<sup>t</sup> May-polle to be cutt downe, and rebuked
      them for their profannes, and admonished them to looke ther should be
      better walking; so they now, or others, changed y<sup>e</sup> name of
      their place againe, and called it Mounte-Dagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to maintaine this riotous prodigallitie and profuse excess, Morton,
      thinking him selfe lawless, and hearing what gaine y<sup>e</sup> French
      &amp; fisher-men made by trading of peeces, powder, &amp; shotte to y<sup>e</sup>
      Indeans, he, as y<sup>e</sup> head of this consortship, begane y<sup>e</sup>
      practise of y<sup>e</sup> same in these parts; and first he taught them
      how to use them, to charge, &amp; discharg, and what proportion of powder
      to give y<sup>e</sup> peece, according to y<sup>e</sup> sise or bignes of
      y<sup>e</sup> same; and what shotte to use for foule, and what for deare.
      And having thus instructed them, he imployed some of them to hunte &amp;
      fowle for him, so as they became farr more active in that imploymente then
      any of y<sup>e</sup> English, by reason of ther <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>swiftnes of foote, &amp;
      nimblnes of body, being also quick-sighted, and by continuall exercise
      well knowing y<sup>e</sup> hants of all sorts of game. So as when they saw
      y<sup>e</sup> execution that a peece would doe, and y<sup>e</sup> benefite
      that might come by y<sup>e</sup> same, they became madd, as it were, after
      them, and would not stick to give any prise they could attaine too for
      them; accounting their bowes &amp; arrowes but bables in comparison of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here I may take occasion to bewaile y<sup>e</sup> mischefe that this
      wicked man began in these parts, and which since base covetousnes
      prevailing in men that should know better, has now at length gott y<sup>e</sup>
      upper hand, and made this thing com&#773;one, notwithstanding any laws to
      y<sup>e</sup> contrary; so as y<sup>e</sup> Indeans are full of peeces all
      over, both fouling peeces, muskets, pistols, &amp;c. They have also their
      moulds to make shotte, of all sorts, as muskett bulletts, pistoll bullets,
      swane &amp; gose shote, &amp; of smaler sorts; yea, some have seen them
      have their scruplats to make scrupins them selves, when they wante them,
      with sundery other implements, wherwith they are ordinarily better fited
      &amp; furnished then y<sup>e</sup> English them selves. Yea, it is well
      knowne that they will have powder &amp; shot, when the English want it,
      nor cannot gett it; and y<sup>t</sup> in a time of warr or danger, as
      experience hath manifested, that when lead hath been scarce, and men for
      their owne defence would gladly have given a groat a l which is dear
      enoughe, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>yet
      hath it bene bought up &amp; sent to other places, and sould to shuch as
      trade it with y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, at 12. pence y<sup>e</sup> li.; and
      it is like they give 3. or 4.<sup>s</sup> y<sup>e</sup> pound, for they
      will have it at any rate. And these things have been done in y<sup>e</sup>
      same times, when some of their neigbours &amp; freinds are daly killed by
      y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, or are in deanger therof, and live but at y<sup>e</sup>
      Indeans mercie. [161] Yea, some (as they have aquainted them with all
      other things) have tould them how gunpowder is made, and all y<sup>e</sup>
      materialls in it, and that they are to be had in their owne land; and I am
      confidente, could they attaine to make saltpeter, they would teach them to
      make powder. O the horiblnes of this vilanie! how many both Dutch &amp;
      English have been latly slaine by those Indeans, thus furnished; and no
      remedie provided, nay, y<sup>e</sup> evill more increased, and y<sup>e</sup>
      blood of their brethren sould for gaine, as is to be feared; and in what
      danger all these colonies are in is too well known. Oh! that princes &amp;
      parlements would take some timly order to prevente this mischeefe, and at
      length to suppress it, by some exemplerie punishmente upon some of these
      gaine thirstie murderers, (for they deserve no better title,) before their
      collonies in these parts be over throwne by these barbarous savages, thus
      armed with their owne weapons, by these evill instruments, and traytors to
      their neigbors and cuntrie. But I have forgott my selfe, and have been to
      longe in this digression; but now to returne. This Morton having <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>thus
      taught them y<sup>e</sup> use of peeces, he sould them all he could spare;
      and he and his consorts detirmined to send for many out of England, and
      had by some of y<sup>e</sup> ships sente for above a score. The which
      being knowne, and his neigbours meeting y<sup>e</sup> Indeans in y<sup>e</sup>
      woods armed with guns in this sorte, it was a terrour unto them, who lived
      straglingly, and were of no strenght in any place. And other places
      (though more remote) saw this mischeefe would quietly spread over all, if
      not prevented. Besides, they saw they should keep no servants, for Morton
      would entertaine any, how vile soever, and all y<sup>e</sup> scume of y<sup>e</sup>
      countrie, or any discontents, would flock to him from all places, if this
      nest was not broken; and they should stand in more fear of their lives
      &amp; goods (in short time) from this wicked &amp; deboste crue, then from
      y<sup>e</sup> salvages them selves.
    </p>
    <p>
      So sundrie of y<sup>e</sup> cheefe of y<sup>e</sup> stragling plantations,
      meeting togither, agreed by mutuall consente to sollissite those of
      Plimoth (who were then of more strength then them all) to joyne with them,
      to prevente y<sup>e</sup> further grouth of this mischeefe, and suppress
      Morton &amp; his consortes before y<sup>ey</sup> grewe to further head and
      strength. Those that joyned in this acction (and after contributed to the
      charge of sending him for England) were from Pascataway, Namkeake,
      Winisimett, Weesagascusett, Natasco, and other places wher any English
      were seated. Those of Plimoth being thus sought too by their messengers
      &amp; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>letters,
      and waying both their reasons, and the com&#773;one danger, were willing
      to afford them their help; though them selves had least cause of fear or
      hurte. So, to be short, they first resolved joyntly to write to him, and
      in a freindly &amp; neigborly way to admonish him to forbear these
      courses, &amp; sent a messenger with their letters to bring his answer.
      But he was so highe as he scorned all advise, and asked who had to doe
      with him; he had and would trade peeces with y<sup>e</sup> Indeans in
      dispite of all, with many other scurillous termes full of disdaine. They
      sente to him a second time, and bad him be better advised, and more
      temperate in his termes, for y<sup>e</sup> countrie could not beare y<sup>e</sup>
      injure he did; it was against their comone saftie, and against y<sup>e</sup>
      king's proclamation. He answerd in high terms as before, and that y<sup>e</sup>
      kings proclamation was no law; demanding what penaltie was upon it. It was
      answered, more then he could [162] bear, his majesties displeasure. But
      insolently he persisted, and said y<sup>e</sup> king was dead and his
      displeasure with him, &amp; many y<sup>e</sup> like things; and threatened
      withall that if any came to molest him, let them looke to them selves, for
      he would prepare for them. Upon which they saw ther was no way but to take
      him by force; and having so farr proceeded, now to give over would make
      him farr more hautie &amp; insolente. So they mutually resolved to
      proceed, and obtained of y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> of Plimoth to send
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>Captaine
      Standish, &amp; some other aide with him, to take Morton by force. The
      which accordingly was done; but they found him to stand stifly in his
      defence, having made fast his dors, armed his consorts, set diverse dishes
      of powder &amp; bullets ready on y<sup>e</sup> table; and if they had not
      been over armed with drinke, more hurt might have been done. They som&#773;aned
      him to yeeld, but he kept his house, and they could gett nothing but
      scofes &amp; scorns from him; but at length, fearing they would doe some
      violence to y<sup>e</sup> house, he and some of his crue came out, but not
      to yeeld, but to shoote; but they were so steeld with drinke as their
      peeces were to heavie for them; him selfe with a carbine (over charged
      &amp; allmost halfe fild with powder &amp; shote, as was after found) had
      thought to have shot Captaine Standish; but he stept to him, &amp; put by
      his peece, &amp; tooke him. Neither was ther any hurte done to any of
      either side, save y<sup>t</sup> one was so drunke y<sup>t</sup> he rane
      his owne nose upon y<sup>e</sup> pointe of a sword y<sup>t</sup> one held
      before him as he entred y<sup>e</sup> house; but he lost but a litle of
      his hott blood. Morton they brought away to Plimoth, wher he was kepte,
      till a ship went from y<sup>e</sup> Ile of Shols for England, with which
      he was sente to y<sup>e</sup> Counsell of New-England; and letters writen
      to give them information of his course &amp; cariage; and also one was
      sent at their com&#773;one charge to informe their Ho<sup>rs</sup> more
      perticulerly, &amp; to prosecute against him. But he foold of y<sup>e</sup>
      messenger, after he was gone <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292"
      id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>from hence, and though he wente for England,
      yet nothing was done to him, not so much as rebukte, for ought was heard;
      but returned y<sup>e</sup> nexte year. Some of y<sup>e</sup> worst of y<sup>e</sup>
      company were disperst, and some of y<sup>e</sup> more modest kepte y<sup>e</sup>
      house till he should be heard from. But I have been too long aboute so
      un-worthy a person, and bad a cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton brought over a yonge man for a minister
      to y<sup>e</sup> people hear, wheather upon his owne head, or at y<sup>e</sup>
      motion of some freinds ther, I well know not, but it was without y<sup>e</sup>
      churches sending; for they had bene so bitten by M<sup>r</sup>. Lyford, as
      they desired to know y<sup>e</sup> person well whom they should invite
      amongst them. His name was M<sup>r</sup>. Rogers; but they perceived, upon
      some triall, that he was crased in his braine; so they were faine to be at
      further charge to send him back againe y<sup>e</sup> nexte year, and loose
      all y<sup>e</sup> charge that was expended in his hither bringing, which
      was not smalle by M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton's accounte, in provissions,
      aparell, bedding, &amp;c. After his returne he grue quite distracted, and
      M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton was much blamed y<sup>t</sup> he would bring such
      a man over, they having charge enough otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton, in y<sup>e</sup> years before, had brought over
      some small quantie of goods, upon his owne perticuler, and sould them for
      his owne private benefite; which was more then any man had yet hithertoo
      attempted. But because he had other wise done them good service, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>and also
      he sould them among y<sup>e</sup> people at y<sup>e</sup> plantation, by
      which their wants were supplied, and he aledged it was the [163] love of M<sup>r</sup>.
      Sherley and some other freinds that would needs trust him with some goods,
      conceiveing it might doe him some good, and none hurte, it was not much
      lookt at, but past over. But this year he brought over a greater
      quantitie, and they were so intermixte with y<sup>e</sup> goods of y<sup>e</sup>
      generall, as they knew not which were theirs, &amp; w<sup>ch</sup> was
      his, being pact up together; so as they well saw that, if any casualty had
      beefalne at sea, he might have laid y<sup>e</sup> whole on them, if he
      would; for ther was no distinction. Allso what was most vendible, and
      would yeeld presente pay, usualy that was his; and he now begane allso to
      sell abroad to others of forine places, which, considering their com&#773;one
      course, they began to dislike. Yet because love thinkes no evill, nor is
      susspitious, they tooke his faire words for excuse, and resolved to send
      him againe this year for England; considering how well he had done y<sup>e</sup>
      former bussines, and what good acceptation he had with their freinds ther;
      as also seeing sundry of their freinds from Leyden were sente for, which
      would or might be much furthered by his means. Againe, seeing the patente
      for Kenebeck must be inlarged, by reason of y<sup>e</sup> former mistaks
      in the bounding of it, and it was conceived, in a maner, y<sup>e</sup>
      same charge would serve to inlarge this at home with it, and he that had
      begane <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup>
      former y<sup>e</sup> last year would be y<sup>e</sup> fittest to effecte
      this; so they gave him instructions and sente him for England this year
      againe. And in his instructions bound him to bring over no goods on their
      accounte, but 50<sup>li</sup>. in hose &amp; shoes, and some linen cloth,
      (as y<sup>ey</sup> were bound by covenante when they tooke y<sup>e</sup>
      trad;) also some trading goods to such a value; and in no case to exseed
      his instructions, nor run&#773;e them into any further charge; he well
      knowing how their state stood. Also y<sup>t</sup> he should so provide y<sup>t</sup>
      their trading goods came over betimes, and what so ever was sent on their
      accounte should be pact up by it selfe, marked with their marke, and no
      other goods to be mixed with theirs. For so he prayed them to give him
      such instructions as they saw good, and he would folow them, to prevente
      any jellocie or farther offence, upon the former forementioned dislikes.
      And thus they conceived they had well provided for all things.

      M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton safly arriving in England, and delivering his
      leters to their freinds their, and aquainting them with his instructions,
      found good acceptation with them, and they were very forward &amp; willing
      to joyne with them in y<sup>e</sup> partnership of trade, &amp; in y<sup>e</sup>
      charge to send over y<sup>e</sup> Leyden people; a company wherof were
      allready come out of Holand, and prepared to come over, and so were sent
      away before M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>could be ready to come. They
      had passage with y<sup>e</sup> ships that came to Salem, that brought over
      many godly persons to begine y<sup>e</sup> plantations &amp; churches of
      Christ ther, &amp; in y<sup>e</sup> Bay of Massachussets; so their long
      stay &amp; keeping back [164] was recompensed by y<sup>e</sup> Lord to
      ther freinds here with a duble blessing, in that they not only injoyed
      them now beyond ther late expectation, (when all their hops seemed to be
      cutt of,) but, with them, many more godly freinds &amp; Christian
      breethren, as y<sup>e</sup> begining of a larger harvest unto y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord, in y<sup>e</sup> increase of his churches &amp; people in these
      parts, to y<sup>e</sup> admiration of many, and allmost wonder of y<sup>e</sup>
      world; that of so small beginings so great things should insue, as time
      after manifested; and that here should be a resting place for so many of y<sup>e</sup>

        and also for your freinds at Leyden. M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp, M<sup>r</sup>.
        Andrews, M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley, &amp; my selfe, doe so like and
        approve of it, as we are willing to joyne with you, and, God directing
        and inabling us, will be assisting and helpfull to you, y<sup>e</sup>
        best y<sup>t</sup> possiblie we can. Nay, had you not taken this course,
        I doe not see how you should accomplish y<sup>e</sup> end you first
        aimed at, and some others indevored these years past. We know it must
        keep us from y<sup>e</sup> profite, which otherwise by y<sup>e</sup>
        blessing of God and your indeaours, might be gained; for most of those
        that came in May, &amp; these now sente, though I hope honest &amp; good
        people, yet not like to be helpfull to raise profite, but rather, ney,
        certaine must, some while, be chargable to you &amp; us; at which it is
        lickly, had not this wise &amp; discreete course been taken, many of
        your generalitie would have grudged. Againe, you say well in your
        letter, and I make no doubte but you will performe it, that now being
        but a few, on whom y<sup>e</sup> burthen must be, you will both menage
        it y<sup>e</sup> beter, and sett too it more cherfully, haveing no
        discontente nor <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>contradiction,
        but so lovingly to joyne togeither, in affection and counsell, as God no
        doubte will blesse and prosper your honest labours &amp; indeavors. And
        therfore in all respects I doe not see but you have done marvelously
        discreetly, &amp; advisedly, and no doubt but it gives all parties good
        contente; I mean y<sup>t</sup> are reasonable &amp; honest men, such as
        make conscience of giving y<sup>e</sup> best satisfaction they be able
        for their debts, and y<sup>t</sup> regard not their owne perticuler so
        much as y<sup>e</sup> accomplishing of y<sup>t</sup> good end for which
        this bussines was first intended, &amp;c. Thus desiring y<sup>e</sup>
        Lord to blese &amp; prosper you, &amp; all yours, and all our honest
        endeavors, I rest

      [165] That I may handle things together, I have put these 2. companies
      that came from Leyden in this place; though they came at 2. severall
      times, yet they both came out of England this year. The former company,
      being 35. persons, were shiped in May, and arived here aboute August. The
      later were shiped in y<sup>e</sup> begining of March, and arived hear y<sup>e</sup>
      later end of May, 1630. M<sup>r</sup>. Sherleys 2. letters, y<sup>e</sup>
      effect wherof I have before related, (as much of them as is pertinente,)
      mentions both. Their charge, as M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton brought it in
      afterwards on accounte, came to above 550<sup>li</sup>. besids ther
      fetching hither from Salem &amp; y<sup>e</sup> Bay, wher they and their
      goods were landed; viz. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298"
      id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>their transportation from Holland to
      England, &amp; their charges lying ther, and passages hither, with
      clothing provided for them. For I find by accounte for y<sup>e</sup> one
      company, 125. yeards of karsey, 127. ellons of linen cloath, shoes, 66. p&#818;<sup>r</sup>,
      with many other perticulers. The charge of y<sup>e</sup> other company is
      reckoned on y<sup>e</sup> severall families, some 50<sup>li</sup>., some
      40<sup>li</sup>., some 30<sup>li</sup>., and so more or less, as their
      number &amp; expencess were. And besids all this charg, their freinds
      &amp; bretheren here were to provid corne &amp; other provissions for
      them, till they could reap a crope which was long before. Those that came
      in May were thus maintained upward of 16. or 18. months, before they had
      any harvest of their owne, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> other by proportion. And
      all they could doe in y<sup>e</sup> mean time was to gett them some
      housing, and prepare them grounds to plant on, against the season. And
      this charg of maintaining them all this while was litle less then y<sup>e</sup>
      former sume. These things I note more perticulerly, for sundry regards.
      First, to shew a rare example herein of brotherly love, and Christian care
      in performing their promises and covenants to their bretheren, too, &amp;
      in a sorte beyonde their power; that they should venture so desperatly to
      ingage them selves to accomplish this thing, and bear it so cheerfully;
      for they never demanded, much less had, any repaymente of all these great
      sumes thus disbursed. 2<sup>ly</sup>. It must needs be that ther was more
      then of man in these acheevements, that should thus readily stire up <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup>
      harts of shuch able frinds to joyne in partnership with them in shuch a
      case, and cleave so faithfullie to them as these did, in so great
      adventures; and the more because the most of them never saw their faces to
      this day; ther being neither kindred, aliance, or other acquaintance or
      relations betweene any of them, then hath been before mentioned; it must
      needs be therfore the spetiall worke and hand of God. 3<sup>ly</sup>. That
      these poore people here in a wilderness should, notwithstanding, be
      inabled in time to repay all these ingagments, and many more unjustly
      brought upon them through the unfaithfullnes of some, and many other great
      losses which they sustained, which will be made manifest, if y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord be pleased to give life and time. In y<sup>e</sup> mean time, I
      cannot but admire his ways and workes towards his servants, and humbly
      desire to blesse his holy name for his great mercies hithertoo.

    <p>
      [166] The Leyden people being thus come over, and sundry of y<sup>e</sup>
      generalitie seeing &amp; hearing how great y<sup>e</sup> charg was like to
      be that was that way to be expended, they begane to murmure and repine at
      it, notwithstanding y<sup>e</sup> burden lay on other mens shoulders;
      espetially at y<sup>e</sup> paying of y<sup>e</sup> 3. bushells of corne a
      year, according to y<sup>e</sup> former agreemente, when y<sup>e</sup>
      trad was lett for y<sup>e</sup> 6. years aforesaid. But to give them
      contente herein allso, it was promised them, that if they could doe it in
      y<sup>e</sup> time without it, they would never demand it of them; which
      gave them good contente. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300"
      id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>And indeed it never was paid, as will
      appeare by y<sup>e</sup> sequell.

      Concerning M<sup>r</sup>. Allertons proceedings about y<sup>e</sup>

      &amp; Kenebeck, will best appere by another leter of M<sup>r</sup>.
      Sherleys; for though much time &amp; money was expended aboute it, yet he

        Most worthy &amp; loving freinds, &amp;c.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of your letters I received in July, &amp; some since by M<sup>r</sup>.
        Peirce, but till our maine bussines, y<sup>e</sup> patent, was granted,
        I could not setle my mind nor pen to writing. M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton
        was so turrmoyled about it, as verily I would not nor could not have
        undergone it, if I might have had a thousand pounds; but y<sup>e</sup>
        Lord so blessed his labours (even beyond expectation in these evill
        days) as he obtained y<sup>e</sup> love &amp; favore of great men in
        repute &amp; place. He got granted from y<sup>e</sup> Earle of Warwick
        &amp; S<sup>r</sup>. Ferdinando Gorge all that M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow
        desired in his letters to me, &amp; more also, which I leave to him to
        relate. Then he sued to y<sup>e</sup> king to confirme their grante, and
        to make you a corporation, and so to inable you to make &amp; execute
        lawes, in such large &amp; ample maner as y<sup>e</sup> Massachusett
        plantation hath it; which y<sup>e</sup> king graciously granted,
        referring it to y<sup>e</sup> Lord Keeper to give order to y<sup>e</sup>
        solisiter to draw it up, if ther were a presidente for it. So y<sup>e</sup>
        Lord Keeper furthered it all he could, and allso y<sup>e</sup>
        solissiter; but as Festus said to Paule, With no small sume of money
        obtained I this freedom; for by y<sup>e</sup> way many ridells must be
        resolved, and many locks must be opened with y<sup>e</sup> silver, ney,
        y<sup>e</sup> golden key. Then it was to come to y<sup>e</sup> Lord
        Treasurer, to have his warrente <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301"
        id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>for freeing y<sup>e</sup> custume for a
        certaine time; but be would not doe it, but refferd it to y<sup>e</sup>
        Counsell table. And ther M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton atended day by day,
        when they sate, but could not gett his petition read. And by reason of M<sup>r</sup>.
        Peirce his staying with all y<sup>e</sup> passengers at Bristoll, he was
        forct to leave y<sup>e</sup> further prosecuting of it to a solissiter.
        But ther is no fear nor doubte but it will be granted, for he hath y<sup>e</sup>
        cheefe of them to freind; yet it will be marvelously needfull for him to
        returne by y<sup>e</sup> first ship y<sup>t</sup> comes from thence; for
        if you had this confirmed, then were you compleate, and might bear such
        sway &amp; goverment as were fitt for your ranke &amp; place y<sup>t</sup>
        God hath called you unto; and stope y<sup>e</sup> moueths of base and
        scurrulous fellowes, y<sup>t</sup> are ready to question &amp; threaten
        you in every action you [167] doe. And besids, if you have y<sup>e</sup>
        custome free for 7. years inward, &amp; 21. outward, y<sup>e</sup>
        charge of y<sup>e</sup> patent will be soone recovered, and ther is no
        fear of obtaining<a name="FNanchor_CL_90" id="FNanchor_CL_90"></a><a
        href="#Footnote_CL_90" class="fnanchor">[CL]</a> it. But such things
        must work by degrees; men cannot hasten it as they would; werefore we (I
        write in behalfe of all our partners here) desire you to be ernest with
        M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton to come, and his wife to spare him this one year
        more, to finish this great &amp; waighty bussines, which we conceive
        will be much for your good, &amp; I hope for your posteritie, and for
        many generations to come.

    <p>
      Thus much of this letter. It was dated y<sup>e</sup> 19. March, 1629.
    </p>
    <p>
      By which it appears what progress was made herein, &amp; in part what
      charge it was, and how left unfinished, and some reason of y<sup>e</sup>
      same; but in truth (as was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302"
      id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>afterwards appehended) the meaine reason was
      M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton's policie, to have an opportunitie to be sent over
      againe, for other regards; and for that end procured them thus to write.
      For it might then well enough have been finshed, if not with y<sup>t</sup>
      clause aboute y<sup>e</sup> custumes, which was M<sup>r</sup>. Allertons
      &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Sherleys device, and not at all thought on by y<sup>e</sup>
      colony here, nor much regarded, yet it might have been done without it,
      without all queston, having passed y<sup>e</sup> kings hand; nay it was
      conceived it might then have beene done with it, if he had pleased; but
      covetousnes never brings ought home, as y<sup>e</sup> proverb is, for this
      oppertunytie being lost, it was never accomplished, but a great deale of
      money veainly &amp; lavishly cast away aboute it, as doth appear upon
      their accounts. But of this more in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      M<sup>r</sup>. Alerton gave them great and just ofence in this (which I
      had omited<a name="FNanchor_CM_91" id="FNanchor_CM_91"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_CM_91" class="fnanchor">[CM]</a> and almost forgotten),&mdash;in
      bringing over this year, for base gaine, that unworthy man, and
      instrumente of mischeefe, Morton, who was sent home but y<sup>e</sup> year
      before for his misdemenors. He not only brought him over, but to y<sup>e</sup>
      towne (as it were to nose them), and lodged him at his owne house, and for
      a while used him as a scribe to doe his bussines, till he was caused to
      pack him away. So he wente to his old nest in y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets,
      wher it was not long <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>but
      by his miscariage he gave them just occation to lay hands on him; and he
      was by them againe sent prisoner into England, wher he lay a good while in
      Exeter Jeole. For besids his miscariage here, he was vemently suspected
      for y<sup>e</sup> murder of a man that had adventured moneys with him,
      when he came first into New-England. And a warrente was sente from y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord Cheefe Justice to apprehend him, by vertue wherof he was by the Gov<sup>r</sup>
      of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets sent into England; and for other his
      misdemenors amongst them, they demolisht his house, that it might be no
      longer a roost for shuch unclaine birds to nestle in. Yet he got free
      againe, and write an infamouse &amp; scurillous booke against many godly
      &amp; cheefe men of y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie; full of lyes &amp; slanders,
      and fraight with profane callumnies against their names and persons, and y<sup>e</sup>
      ways of God. After sundry years, when y<sup>e</sup> warrs were hott in
      England, he came againe into y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie, and was imprisoned at
      Boston for this booke and other things, being grown old in wickednes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning y<sup>e</sup> rest of M<sup>r</sup>. Allertons instructions, in
      which they strictly injoyned him not to exceed above y<sup>t</sup> 50<sup>li</sup>.
      in y<sup>e</sup> goods before mentioned, not to bring any but trading com&#773;odities,
      he followed them not at all, but did the quite contrarie; bringing over
      many other sorts of retaile goods, selling what he could by the way on his
      owne accounte, and delivering the rest, which he said to be theirs, into y<sup>e</sup>
      store; and for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>trading
      goods brought but litle in comparison; excusing the matter, they had laid
      out much about y<sup>e</sup> Laiden people, &amp; patent, &amp;c. And for
      other goods, they had much of them of ther owne dealings, without present
      disbursemente, &amp; to like effect. And as for passing his bounds &amp;
      instructions, he laid it on M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley, &amp;c., who, he said,
      they might see his mind in his leters; also that they had sett out Ashley
      at great charg; but next year they should have what trading goods they
      would send for, if things were now well setled, &amp;c. And thus were they
      put off; indeed M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley write things tending this way, but
      it is like he was overruled by M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton, and harkened more
      to him then to their letters from hence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he further writs in y<sup>e</sup> former leter.
    </p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        I see what you write in your leters concerning y<sup>e</sup> over-com&#773;ing
        &amp; paying of our debts, which I confess are great, and had need be
        carfully looked unto; yet no doubt but we, joyning in love, may soone
        over-come them; but we must follow it roundly &amp; to purposs, for if
        we pedle out y<sup>e</sup> time of our trad, others will step in and
        nose us. But we know y<sup>t</sup> you have y<sup>t</sup> aquaintance
        &amp; experience in y<sup>e</sup> countrie, as none have the like;
        wherfore, freinds &amp; partners, be no way discouraged with y<sup>e</sup>
        greatnes of y<sup>e</sup> debt, &amp;c., but let us not fulfill y<sup>e</sup>
        proverbe, to bestow 12<sup>d</sup>. on a purse, and put 6<sup>d</sup>.
        [168] in it; but as you and we have been at great charg, and undergone
        much for setling you ther, and to gaine experience, so as God shall
        enable us, let us make use of it. And think not with 50<sup>li</sup>.
        pound a yeare sent you over, to rayse shuch means as to pay our debts.
        We see a possibillitie <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305"
        id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>of good if you be well supplied, and fully
        furnished; and cheefly if you lovingly agree. I know I write to godly
        and wise men, such as have lerned to bear one an others infirmities, and
        rejoyce at any ones prosperities; and if I were able I would press this
        more, because it is hoped by some of your enimies, that you will fall
        out one with another, and so over throw your hopfull bussines. Nay, I
        have heard it crediblie reported, y<sup>t</sup> some have said, that
        till you be disjoynted by discontents &amp; factions<a

        over, in hope of getting or doing good in those parts. But we hope beter
        things of you, and that you will not only bear one with another, but
        banish such thoughts, and not suffer them to lodg in your brests. God
        grant you may disappointe y<sup>e</sup> hopes of your foes, and procure
        y<sup>e</sup> hartie desire of your selves &amp; freinds in this
        perticuler.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      By this it appears that ther was a kind of concurrance betweene M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton and them in these things, and that they gave more regard to his
      way &amp; course in these things, then to y<sup>e</sup> advise from hence;
      which made him bould to presume above his instructions, and to rune on in
      y<sup>e</sup> course he did, to their greater hurt afterwards, as will
      appear. These things did much trouble them hear, but they well knew not
      how to help it, being loath to make any breach or contention hear aboute;
      being so premonished as before in y<sup>e</sup> leter above recited. An
      other more secrete cause was herewith concurrente; M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton
      had maried y<sup>e</sup> daughter of their Reverend Elder, M<sup>r</sup>.
      Brewster (a man beloved <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306"
      id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>&amp; honoured amongst them, and who tooke
      great paines in teaching &amp; dispenceing y<sup>e</sup> word of God unto
      them), whom they were loath to greeve or any way offend, so as they bore
      with much in that respecte. And with all M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton carried
      so faire with him, and procured such leters from M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley to
      him, with shuch applause of M<sup>r</sup>. Allertons wisdom, care, and
      faithfullnes, in y<sup>e</sup> bussines; and as things stood none were so
      fitte to send aboute them as he; and if any should suggest other wise, it
      was rather out of envie, or some other sinister respecte then other wise.
      Besids, though private gaine, I doe perswade my selfe, was some cause to
      lead M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton aside in these beginings, yet I thinke, or at
      least charitie caries me to hope, that he intended to deale faithfully
      with them in y<sup>e</sup> maine, and had such an opinion of his owne
      abillitie, and some experience of y<sup>e</sup> benefite that he had made
      in this singuler way, as he conceived he might both raise him selfe an
      estate, and allso be a means to bring in such profite to M<sup>r</sup>.
      Sherley, (and it may be y<sup>e</sup> rest,) as might be as lickly to
      bring in their moneys againe with advantage, and it may be sooner then
      from the generall way; or at least it was looked upon by some of them to
      be a good help ther unto; and that neither he nor any other did intend to
      charge y<sup>e</sup> generall accounte with any thing that rane in
      perticuler; or y<sup>t</sup> M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley or any other did
      purposs but y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> generall should be first &amp;
      fully supplyed. I say charitie <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307"
      id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>makes me thus conceive; though things fell
      out other wise, and they missed of their aimes, and y<sup>e</sup> generall
      suffered abundantly hereby, as will afterwards apear.

      Allerton and them ther, w<sup>th</sup>out any knowledg of y<sup>e</sup>

      therof, and joyne in y<sup>e</sup> same, though they had no great liking
      of it, but feared what might be y<sup>e</sup> evente of y<sup>e</sup>
      same. I shall relate it in a further part of M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley's

      <p>
        I am to aquainte you that we have thought good to joyne with one Edward
        Ashley (a man I thinke y<sup>t</sup> some of you know); but it is only
        of y<sup>t</sup> place wherof he hath a patente in M<sup>r</sup>.
        Beachamps name; and to that end have furnished him with larg
        provissions, &amp;c. Now if you please to be partners with us in this,
        we are willing you shall; for after we heard how forward Bristoll men
        (and as I hear some able men of his owne kindrid) have been to stock
        &amp; supply him, hoping of profite, we thought it fitter for us to lay
        hould of such an opportunitie, and to keep a kind of run&#773;ing
        plantation, then others who have not borne y<sup>e</sup> burthen of
        setling a plantation, as we have done. And he, on y<sup>e</sup> other
        side, like an understanding yonge man, thought it better to joyne with
        those y<sup>t</sup> had means by a plantation to supply &amp; back him
        ther, rather then strangers, that looke but only after profite. Now it
        is not knowne that you are partners with him; but only we 4., M<sup>r</sup>.
        Andrews, M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp, my selfe, &amp; M<sup>r</sup>.
        Hatherley, who desired to have y<sup>e</sup> patente, in consideration
        of our great loss we have allready sustained in setling y<sup>e</sup>
        first plantation ther; so we agreed togeather to <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>take it in our names. And
        now, as I said before, if you please to joyne with us, we are willing
        you should. M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton had no power from you to make this
        new contracte, neither was he willing to doe any thing therin without
        your consente &amp; approbation. M<sup>r</sup>. William Peirce is joyned
        with us in this, for we thought it very conveniente, because of landing
        Ashley and his goods ther, if God please; and he will bend his course
        accordingly. He hath a new boate with him, and boards to make another,
        with 4. or 5. lustie fellowes, wherof one is a carpenter. Now in case
        you are not willing in this perticuler to joyne with us, fearing y<sup>e</sup>
        charge &amp; doubting y<sup>e</sup> success, yet thus much we intreate
        of you, to afford him all the help you can, either by men, commodities,
        or boats; yet not but y<sup>t</sup> we will pay you for any thing he
        hath. And we desire you to keep y<sup>e</sup> accounts apart, though you
        joyne with us; becase ther is, as you see, other partners in this then y<sup>e</sup>
        other; so, for all mens wages, boats-hire, or comodities, which we shall
        have of you, make him debtore for it; and what you shall have of him,
        make y<sup>e</sup> plantation or your selves debtore for it to him, and
        so ther will need no mingling of y<sup>e</sup> accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, loving freinds &amp; partners, if you joyne in Ashles patent
        &amp; bussines, though we have laid out y<sup>e</sup> money and taken up
        much to stock this bussines &amp; the other, yet I thinke it
        conscionable and reasonable y<sup>t</sup> you should beare your shares
        and proportion of y<sup>e</sup> stock, if not by present money, yet by
        securing us for so much as it shall come too; for it is not barly y<sup>e</sup>
        interest that is to be alowed &amp; considered of, but allso y<sup>e</sup>
        adventure; though I hope in God, by his blessing &amp; your honest
        indeavors, it may soon be payed; yet y<sup>e</sup> years y<sup>t</sup>
        this partnership holds is not long, nor many; let all therfore lay it to
        harte, and make y<sup>e</sup> best use of y<sup>e</sup> time that
        possiblie we cann, and let every man <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>put too his shoulder, and
        y<sup>e</sup> burthen will be the lighter. I know you are so honest
        &amp; conscionable men, as you will consider hereof, [170] and returne
        shuch an answer as may give good satisfaction. Ther is none of us that
        would venture as we have done, were it not to strengthen &amp; setle you
        more then our owne perticuler profite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ther is no liclyhood of doing any good in buying y<sup>e</sup> debte for
        y<sup>e</sup> purchas. I know some will not abate y<sup>e</sup>
        interest, and therfore let it rune its course; they are to be paied
        yearly, and so I hope they shall, according to agreemente. The Lord
        grant y<sup>t</sup> our loves &amp; affections may still be united, and
        knit togeither; and so we rest your ever loving friends,

        Bristoll, March 19. 1629.

    <p>
      This mater of y<sup>e</sup> buying y<sup>e</sup> debts of y<sup>e</sup>
      purchass was parte of M<sup>r</sup>. Allertons instructions, and in many
      of them it might have been done to good profite for ready pay (as some
      were); but M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley had no mind to it. But this bussines
      aboute Ashley did not a litle trouble them; for though he had wite &amp;
      abillitie enough to menage y<sup>e</sup> bussines, yet some of them knew
      him to be a very profane yonge man; and he had for some time lived amonge
      y<sup>e</sup> Indeans as a savage, &amp; wente naked amongst them, and
      used their maners (in w<sup>ch</sup> time he got their language), so they
      feared he might still rune into evill courses (though he promised better),
      and God would not prosper his ways. As soone as he was landed at y<sup>e</sup>
      place intended, caled Penobscote, some 4 score leagues from this place, he
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>write
      (&amp; afterwards came) for to desire to be supplyed with Wampampeake,
      corne against winter, and other things. They considered these were of
      their cheefe com&#773;odities, and would be continually needed by him, and
      it would much prejudice their owne trade at Kenebeck if they did not joyne
      with him in y<sup>e</sup> ordering of things, if thus they should supply
      him; and on y<sup>e</sup> other hand, if they refused to joyne with him,
      and allso to afford any supply unto him, they should greatly offend their
      above named friends, and might hapily lose them hereby; and he and M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton, laying their craftie wits togither, might gett supplies of these
      things els wher; besids, they considered that if they joyned not in y<sup>e</sup>
      bussines, they knew M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton would be with them in it,
      &amp; so would swime, as it were, betweene both, to y<sup>e</sup>
      prejudice of boath, but of them selves espetially. For they had reason to
      thinke this bussines was cheefly of his contriving, and Ashley was a man
      fitte for his turne and dealings. So they, to prevente a worse mischeefe,
      resolved to joyne in y<sup>e</sup> bussines, and gave him supplies in what
      they could, &amp; overlooked his proceedings as well as they could; the
      which they did y<sup>e</sup> better, by joyning an honest yonge man,<a
      name="FNanchor_CO_93" id="FNanchor_CO_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_CO_93"
      class="fnanchor">[CO]</a> that came from Leyden, with him as his fellow
      (in some sorte), and not merely as a servante. Which yonge man being
      discreete, and one whom they could trust, they so instructed as <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>keept
      Ashley in some good mesure within bounds. And so they returned their
      answer to their freinds in England, that they accepted of their motion,
      and joyned with them in Ashleys bussines; and yet withall tould them what
      their fears were concerning him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when they came to have full notice of all y<sup>e</sup> goods brought
      them that year, they saw they fell very short of trading goods, and Ashley
      farr better suppleyed then [171] themselves; so as they were forced to buy
      of the fisher men to furnish them selves, yea, &amp; cottens &amp; carseys
      &amp; other such like cloath (for want of trading cloath) of M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton himselfe, and so to put away a great parte of their beaver, at
      under rate, in the countrie, which they should have sente home, to help to
      discharge their great ingagementes; which was to their great vexation; but
      M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton prayed them to be contente, and y<sup>e</sup>
      nexte yere they might have what they would write for. And their
      ingagmentes of this year were great indeed when they came to know them,
      (which was not wholy till 2. years after); and that which made them y<sup>e</sup>
      more, M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton had taken up some large sum&#773;es at
      Bristoll at 50. p&#818;<sup>r</sup> cent. againe, which he excused, that
      he was forcte to it, because other wise he could at y<sup>e</sup> spring
      of year get no goods transported, such were their envie against their
      trade. But wheither this was any more then an excuse, some of them
      doubted; but however, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312"
      id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup> burden did lye on their backs,
      and they must bear it, as they did many heavie loads more in y<sup>e</sup>
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      This paying of 50. p<sup>r</sup> cent. and dificulty of having their goods
      tr&#257;sported by the fishing ships at y<sup>e</sup> first of y<sup>e</sup>
      year, (as was beleeved,) which was y<sup>e</sup> cheefe season for trade,
      put them upon another projecte. M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton, after y<sup>e</sup>
      fishing season was over, light of a bargan of salte, at a good fishing
      place, and bought it; which came to aboute 113<sup>li</sup>.; and shortly
      after he might have had 30<sup>li</sup>. cleare profite for it, without
      any more trouble aboute it. But M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow coming that way
      from Kenebeck, &amp; some other of ther partners with him in y<sup>e</sup>
      barke, they mett with M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton, and falling into discourse
      with him, they stayed him from selling y<sup>e</sup> salte; and resolved,
      if it might please y<sup>e</sup> rest, to keep it for them selves, and to
      hire a ship in y<sup>e</sup> west cuntrie to come on fishing for them, on
      shares, according to y<sup>e</sup> coustome; and seeing she might have her
      salte here ready, and a stage ready builte &amp; fitted wher the salt lay
      safely landed &amp; housed. In stead of bringing salte, they might stowe
      her full of trading goods, as bread, pease, cloth, &amp;c., and so they
      might have a full supply of goods without paing fraight, and in due
      season, which might turne greatly to their advantage. Coming home, this
      was propounded, and considered on, and aproved by all but y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup>, who had no mind to it, seeing they had allway lost <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>by
      fishing; but y<sup>e</sup> rest were so ernest, as thinkeing that they
      might gaine well by y<sup>e</sup> fishing in this way; and if they should
      but save, yea, or lose some thing by it, y<sup>e</sup> other benefite
      would be advantage inough; so, seeing their ernestnes, he gave way, and it
      was referd to their freinds in England to alow, or disalow it. Of which
      more in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon y<sup>e</sup> consideration of y<sup>e</sup> bussines about y<sup>e</sup>
      paten, &amp; in what state it was left, as is before remembred, and M<sup>r</sup>.
      Sherleys ernest pressing to have M<sup>r</sup>. Allert&#333; to come over
      againe to finish it, &amp; perfect y<sup>e</sup> accounts, &amp;c., it was
      concluded to send him over this year againe; though it was with some fear
      &amp; jeolocie; yet he gave them fair words and promises of well
      performing all their bussineses according to their directions, and to mend
      his former errors. So he was accordingly sent with full instructions for
      all things, with large letters to M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
      rest, both aboute Ashleys bussines and their owne suply with trading
      comodities, and how much it did concerne them to be furnished therwith,
      &amp; what y<sup>e</sup> had suffered for wante therof; and of what litle
      use other goods were [172] in comparison therof; and so likewise aboute
      this fishing ship, to be thus hired, and fraught with trading goods, which
      might both supply them &amp; Ashley, and y<sup>e</sup> benefite therof;
      which was left to their consideration to hire &amp; set her out, or not;
      but in no case not to send any, exepte she was thus fraighte with trading
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>goods.
      But what these things came too will appere in y<sup>e</sup> next years
      passages.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had like to have omited an other passage that fell out y<sup>e</sup>
      begining of this year. Ther was one M<sup>r</sup>. Ralfe Smith, &amp; his
      wife &amp; familie, y<sup>t</sup> came over into y<sup>e</sup> Bay of y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachusets, and sojourned at presente with some stragling people that
      lived at Natascoe; here being a boat of this place putting in ther on some
      occasion, he ernestly desired that they would give him &amp; his, passage
      for Plimoth, and some such things as they could well carrie; having before
      heard y<sup>t</sup> ther was liklyhood he might procure house-roome for
      some time, till he should resolve to setle ther, if he might, or els-wher
      as God should disposs; for he was werie of being in y<sup>t</sup> uncoth
      place, &amp; in a poore house y<sup>t</sup> would neither keep him nor his
      goods drie. So, seeing him to be a grave man, &amp; understood he had been
      a minister, though they had no order for any such thing, yet they presumed
      and brought him. He was here accordingly kindly entertained &amp; housed,
      &amp; had y<sup>e</sup> rest of his goods &amp; servants sente for, and
      exercised his gifts amongst them, and afterwards was chosen into y<sup>e</sup>
      ministrie, and so remained for sundrie years.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was before noted that sundry of those that came from Leyden, came over
      in the ships y<sup>t</sup> came to Salem, wher M<sup>r</sup>. Endecott had
      cheefe com&#773;and; and by infection that grue amonge y<sup>e</sup>
      passengers at sea, it spread also among them a shore, of which many dyed,
      some of y<sup>e</sup> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315"
      id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>scurvie, other of an infectious feaoure,
      which continued some time amongst them (though our people, through Gods
      goodnes, escaped it). Upon which occasion he write hither for some help,
      understanding here was one that had some skill y<sup>t</sup> way, &amp;
      had cured diverse of y<sup>e</sup> scurvie, and others of other diseases,
      by letting blood, &amp; other means. Upon which his request y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> hear sent him unto them, and also write to him, from whom
      he received an answere; the which, because it is breefe, and shows y<sup>e</sup>
      begining of their aquaintance, and closing in y<sup>e</sup> truth &amp;
      ways of God, I thought it not unmeete, nor without use, hear to inserte
      it; and an other showing y<sup>e</sup> begining of their fellowship &amp;

        It is a thing not usuall, that servants to one m<sup>r</sup> and of y<sup>e</sup>
        same houshold should be strangers; I assure you I desire it not, nay, to
        speake more plainly, I cannot be so to you. Gods people are all marked

        ther can be no discorde, nay, here must needs be sweete harmonie. And y<sup>e</sup>

        S<sup>r</sup>: I make bould to trouble you with a few lines, for to
        certifie you how it hath pleased God to deale with us, since you heard
        from us. How, notwithstanding all opposition that hath been hear, &amp;
        els wher, it hath pleased God to lay a foundation, the which I hope is
        agreeable to his word in every thing. The 20. of July, it pleased y<sup>e</sup>
        Lord to move y<sup>e</sup> hart of our Gov<sup>r</sup> to set it aparte
        for a solemne day of humilliation for y<sup>e</sup> choyce of a pastor
        &amp; teacher. The former parte of y<sup>e</sup> day being spente in
        praier &amp; teaching, the later parte aboute y<sup>e</sup> election,
        which was after this maner. The persons thought on (who had been
        ministers in England) <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317"
        id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>were demanded concerning their callings;
        they acknowledged ther was a towfould calling, the one an inward
        calling, when y<sup>e</sup> Lord moved y<sup>e</sup> harte of a man to
        take y<sup>t</sup> calling upon him, and fitted him with guiftes for y<sup>e</sup>
        same; the second was an outward calling, which was from y<sup>e</sup>
        people, when a company of beleevers are joyned togither in covenante, to
        walke togither in all y<sup>e</sup> ways of God, and every member (being
        men) are to have a free voyce in y<sup>e</sup> choyce of their officers,
        &amp;c. Now, we being perswaded that these 2. men were so quallified, as
        y<sup>e</sup> apostle speaks to Timothy, wher he saith, A bishop must be
        blamles, sober, apte to teach, &amp;c., I thinke I may say, as y<sup>e</sup>
        eunuch said unto Philip, What should let from being baptised, seeing
        ther was water? and he beleeved. So these 2. servants of God, clearing
        all things by their answers, (and being thus fitted,) we saw noe reason
        but we might freely give our voyces for their election, after this
        triall. So M<sup>r</sup>. Skelton was chosen pastor, and M<sup>r</sup>.
        Higgison to be teacher; and they accepting y<sup>e</sup> choyce, M<sup>r</sup>.
        Higgison, with 3. or 4. of y<sup>e</sup> gravest members of y<sup>e</sup>
        church, laid their hands on M<sup>r</sup>. Skelton, using prayer
        therwith. This being done, ther was imposission of hands on M<sup>r</sup>.
        Higgison also. And since that time, Thursday (being, as I take it, y<sup>e</sup>
        6. of August) is appoynted for another day of humilliation, for y<sup>e</sup>
        choyce of elders &amp; deacons, &amp; ordaining of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, good S<sup>r</sup>, I hope y<sup>t</sup> you &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
        rest of Gods people (who are aquainted with the ways of God) with you,
        will say that hear was a right foundation layed, and that these 2.
        blessed servants of y<sup>e</sup> Lord came in at y<sup>e</sup> dore,
        and not at y<sup>e</sup> window. Thus I have made bould to trouble you

      Ashley, being well supplyed, had quickly gathered a good parcell of
      beaver, and like a crafty pate he sent it all home, and would not pay for
      y<sup>e</sup> goods he had had of y<sup>e</sup> plantation hear, but lett
      them stand still on y<sup>e</sup> score, and tooke up still more. Now
      though they well enough knew his aime, yet they let him goe on, and write
      of it into England. But partly y<sup>e</sup> beaver they received, &amp;
      sould, (of which they weer sencible,) and partly by M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allertons extolling of him, they cast more how to supplie him then y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation, and something to upbraid them with it. They were forct to buy
      him a barke allso, and to furnish her w<sup>th</sup> a m<sup>r</sup>.
      &amp; men, to transports his corne &amp; provissions (of which he put of
      much); for y<sup>e</sup> Indeans of those parts have no corne growing, and
      at harvest, after corne is ready, y<sup>e</sup> weather grows foule, and y<sup>e</sup>
      seas dangerous, so as he could doe litle good with his shallope for y<sup>t</sup>
      purposs.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked ernestly for a timely supply this spring, by the fishing ship
      which they expected, and had been at charg to keepe a stage for her; but
      none came, nor any supply heard of for them. At length they heard sume
      supply was sent to Ashley by a fishing ship, at which they something
      marvelled, and the more y<sup>t</sup> they had no letters either from M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton or M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley; so they went on in their bussines as
      well as y<sup>e</sup> could. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319"
      id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>At last they heard of M<sup>r</sup>. Peirce
      his arivall in y<sup>e</sup> Bay of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusetts, who
      brought passengers &amp; goods thither. They presently sent a shallop,
      conceiving they should have some thing by him. But he tould them he had
      none; and a ship was sett out on fishing, but after 11. weeks beating at
      sea, she mett with shuch foull weather as she was forcte back againe for
      England, and, y<sup>e</sup> season being over, gave off y<sup>e</sup>
      vioage. Neither did he hear of much goods in her for y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation, or y<sup>t</sup> she did belong to them, for he had heard some
      thing from M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton tending that way. But M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton had bought another ship, and was to come in her, and was to fish
      for bass to y<sup>e</sup> eastward, and to bring goods, &amp;c. These
      things did much trouble them, and half astonish them. M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winslow haveing been to y<sup>e</sup> eastward, brought nuese of the like
      things, w<sup>th</sup> some more perticulers, and y<sup>t</sup> it was
      like M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton would be late before he came. At length they,
      having an oppertunitie, resolved to send M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow, with what
      beaver they had ready, into England, to see how y<sup>e</sup> squars
      wente, being very jeolouse of these things, &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Allertons
      courses; and writ shuch leters, and gave him shuch instructions, as they
      thought meet; and if he found things not well, to discharge M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton for being any longer agent for them, or to deal any more in y<sup>e</sup>
      bussines, and to see how y<sup>e</sup> accounts stood, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aboute y<sup>e</sup> midle of som&#773;er arrives M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley

      Bay of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusetts, (being one of y<sup>e</sup> partners,)
      and came over in y<sup>e</sup> same ship that was set out on fhishing
      (called y<sup>e</sup> Frendship). They presently sent to him, making no
      question but now they had goods come, and should know how all things
      stood. But they found [175] the former news true, how this ship had been
      so long at sea, and spente and spoyled her provissions, and overthrowne y<sup>e</sup>
      viage. And he being sent over by y<sup>e</sup> rest of y<sup>e</sup>
      partners, to see how things wente hear, being at Bristoll with M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton, in y<sup>e</sup> shipe bought (called y<sup>e</sup>
      White-Angell), ready to set sayle, over night came a messenger from
      Bastable to M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton, and tould him of y<sup>e</sup>
      returne of y<sup>e</sup> ship, and what had befallen. And he not knowing
      what to doe, having a great chareg under hand, y<sup>e</sup> ship lying at
      his rates, and now ready to set sayle, got him to goe and discharg y<sup>e</sup>
      ship, and take order for y<sup>e</sup> goods. To be short, they found M<sup>r</sup>.
      Hatherley some thing reserved, and troubled in him selfe, (M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton not being ther,) not knowing how to dispose of y<sup>e</sup>
      goods till he came; but he heard he was arived with y<sup>e</sup> other
      ship to y<sup>e</sup> eastward, and expected his coming. But he tould them
      ther was not much for them in this ship, only 2. packs of Bastable ruggs,
      and 2. hoggsheads of meatheglin, drawne out in wooden flackets (but when
      these flackets came to be received, ther was left but 6. gallons of y<sup>e</sup>
      2. hogsheads, it being drunke up under y<sup>e</sup> name leackage, and so
      lost). <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>But
      the ship was filled with goods for sundrie gentlemen, &amp; others, that
      were come to plant in y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, for which they payed
      fraight by y<sup>e</sup> tun. And this was all the satisfaction they could
      have at presente, so they brought this small parcell of goods &amp;
      returned with this nues, and a letter as obscure; which made them much to
      marvell therat. The letter was as followeth.

        Breefly thus: wee have this year set forth a fishing ship, and a trading
        ship, which later we have bought; and so have disbursed a great deale of
        money, as may and will appeare by y<sup>e</sup> accounts. And because
        this ship (called y<sup>e</sup> White Angell) is to acte 2. parts, (as I
        may say,) fishing for bass, and trading; and that while M<sup>r</sup>.
        Allerton was imployed aboute y<sup>e</sup> trading, the fishing might
        suffer by carlesnes or neglecte of y<sup>e</sup> sailors, we have
        entreated your and our loving friend, M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley, to goe
        over with him, knowing he will be a comforte to M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton,
        a joye to you, to see a carfull and loving friend, and a great stay to y<sup>e</sup>
        bussines; and so great contente to us, that if it should please God y<sup>e</sup>
        one should faile, (as God forbid,) yet y<sup>e</sup> other would keepe
        both recconings, and things uprighte. For we are now out great sumes of
        money, as they will acquainte you withall, &amp;c. When we were out but
        4. or 5. hundred pounds a peece, we looked not much after it, but left
        it to you, &amp; your agente, (who, without flaterie, deserveth infinite
        thanks &amp; comendations, both of you &amp; us, for his pains, &amp;c.);
        but now we are out double, nay, trible a peece, some of us, &amp;c.;
        which maks us both write, and send over our friend, M<sup>r</sup>.
        Hatherley, whom we pray you to entertaine kindly, of which we doubte not
        of. The main end of sending him <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322"
        id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>is to see y<sup>e</sup> state and accounte
        of all y<sup>e</sup> bussines, of all which we pray you informe him
        fully, though y<sup>e</sup> ship &amp; bussines wayte for it and him.
        For we should take it very unkindly that we should intreat him to take
        such a journey, and that, when it pleaseth God he returnes, he could not
        give us contente &amp; satisfaction in this perticuler, through defaulte
        of any of you. [176] But we hope you will so order bussines, as neither
        he nor we shall have cause to complaine, but to doe as we ever have
        done, thinke well of you all, &amp;c. I will not promise, but shall
        indeaour &amp; hope to effecte y<sup>e</sup> full desire and grant of
        your patente, &amp; that ere it be longe. I would not have you take any

      It needs not be thought strange, that these things should amase and
      trouble them; first, that this fishing ship should be set out, and fraight
      with other mens goods, &amp; scarce any of theirs; seeing their maine end
      was (as is before remembred) to bring them a full supply, and their
      speatiall order not to sett out any excepte this was done. And now a ship
      to come on their accounte, clean contrary to their both end &amp; order,
      was a misterie they could not understand; and so much y<sup>e</sup> worse,
      seeing she had shuch ill success as to lose both her vioage &amp;
      provissions. The 2. thing, that another ship should be bought and sente
      out on new designes, a thing not so much as once thought on by <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>any here,
      much less, not a word intimated or spoaken of by any here, either by word
      or letter, neither could they imagine why this should be. Bass fishing was
      never lookt at by them, but as soone as ever they heard on it, they looked
      at it as a vaine thing, that would certainly turne to loss. And for M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton to follow any trade for them, it was never in their thoughts. And
      3<sup>ly</sup>, that their fri&#275;ds should complaine of disbursements,
      and yet rune into such great things, and charge of shiping &amp; new
      projects of their owne heads, not only without, but against, all order
      &amp; advice, was to them very strang. And 4<sup>ly</sup>, that all these
      matters of so great charg &amp; imployments should be thus wrapped up in a
      breefe and obscure letter, they knew not what to make of it. But amids all
      their doubts they must have patience till M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton &amp; M<sup>r</sup>.
      Hatherley should come. In y<sup>e</sup> mean time M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow
      was gone for England; and others of them were forst to folow their
      imployments with y<sup>e</sup> best means they had, till they could hear
      of better.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton came unto
      them, (after they had delivered their goods,) and finding them strucken
      with some sadnes aboute these things, M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton tould them
      that y<sup>e</sup> ship Whit-Angele did not belong to them, nor their
      accounte, neither neede they have any thing to doe with her, excepte they
      would. And M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley confirmed y<sup>e</sup> same, and said
      that they would have had him to have <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>had a parte, but he refused;
      but he made question whether they would not turne her upon y<sup>e</sup>
      generall accounte, if ther came loss (as he now saw was like), seeing M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton laid downe this course, and put them on this projecte. But for y<sup>e</sup>
      fishing ship, he tould them they need not be so much troubled, for he had
      her accounts here, and showed them that her first seting out came not much
      to exceed 600<sup>li</sup>. as they might see by y<sup>e</sup> accounte,
      which he showed them; and for this later viage, it would arrise to profite
      by y<sup>e</sup> fraight of the goods, and y<sup>e</sup> salle of some
      katle which he shiped and had allready sould, &amp; was to be paid for
      partly here &amp; partly by bills into England, so as they should not have
      this put on their acounte at all, except they [178]<a name="FNanchor_CP_94"
      id="FNanchor_CP_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_CP_94" class="fnanchor">[CP]</a>
      would. And for y<sup>e</sup> former, he had sould so much goods out of her
      in England, and imployed y<sup>e</sup> money in this 2. viage, as it,
      togeither with such goods &amp; implements as M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton must
      need aboute his fishing, would rise to a good parte of y<sup>e</sup>
      money; for he must have y<sup>e</sup> sallt and nets, allso spiks, nails,
      &amp;c.; all which would rise to nere 400<sup>li</sup>; so, with y<sup>e</sup>
      bearing of their parts of y<sup>e</sup> rest of the loses (which would not
      be much above 200<sup>li</sup>.), they would clear them of this whole
      accounte. Of which motion they were glad, not being willing to have any
      accounts lye upon them; but aboute their trade, which made them willing to
      harken therunto, and demand of M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley how he could <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>make this
      good, if they should agree their unto, he tould them he was sent over as
      their agente, and had this order from them, that whatsoever he and M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton did togeather, they would stand to it; but they would not alow of
      what M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton did alone, except they liked it; but if he
      did it alone, they would not gaine say it. Upon which they sould to him
      &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton all y<sup>e</sup> rest of y<sup>e</sup>
      goods, and gave them present possession of them; and a writing was made,
      and confirmed under both M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherleys and M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allertons hands, to y<sup>e</sup> effecte afforesaide. And M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allertone, being best aquainted w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> people, sould
      away presenly all shuch goods as he had no need of for y<sup>e</sup>
      fishing, as 9. shallop sails, made of good new canvas, and y<sup>e</sup>
      roads for them being all new, with sundry such usefull goods, for ready
      beaver, by M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherleys allowance. And thus they thought they
      had well provided for them selvs. Yet they rebuked M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton
      very much for runing into these courses, fearing y<sup>e</sup> success of
      them. M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley brought to y<sup>e</sup>
      towne with them (after he had sould what he could abroad) a great quantity
      of other goods besids trading comodities; as linen cloath, bedticks,
      stockings, tape, pins, ruggs, &amp;c., and tould them they were to have
      them, if they would; but they tould M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton that they had
      forbid him before for bringing any such on their accounte; it would hinder
      their trade and returnes. But he &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley said, if
      they would not have them, they <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326"
      id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>would sell them, them selves, and take corne
      for what they could not otherwise sell. They tould them they might, if
      they had order for it. The goods of one sorte &amp; other came to upward
      of 500<sup>li</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these things, Mr. Allerton wente to y<sup>e</sup> ship aboute his
      bass fishing; and M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley, (according to his order,)
      after he tooke knowledg how things stood at y<sup>e</sup> plantation, (of
      all which they informed him fully,) he then desired a boate of them to goe
      and visite y<sup>e</sup> trading houeses, both Kenebeck, and Ashley at
      Penobscote; for so they in England had injoyned him. They accordingly
      furnished him with a boate &amp; men for y<sup>e</sup> viage, and
      aquainted him plainly &amp; thorowly with all things; by which he had good
      contente and satisfaction, and saw plainly that M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton
      plaid his owne game, and rane a course not only to y<sup>e</sup> great
      wrong &amp; detrimente of y<sup>e</sup> plantation, who imployed &amp;
      trusted him, but abused them in England also, in possessing them with
      prejudice against y<sup>e</sup> plantation; as y<sup>t</sup>, they would
      never be able to repaye their moneys (in regard of their great charge),
      but if [179] they would follow his advice and projects, he &amp; Ashley
      (being well supplyed) would quickly bring in their moneys with good
      advantage. Mr. Hatherley disclosed also a further projecte aboute y<sup>e</sup>
      setting out of this ship, y<sup>e</sup> White-angell; how, she being wel
      fitted with good ordnance, and known to have made a great fight at sea
      (when she belongd to Bristoll) and caried away <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>the victory, they had agreed
      (by M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton's means) that, after she had brought a fraight
      of goods here into the countrie, and fraight her selfe with fish, she
      should goe from hence to Port of porte,<a name="FNanchor_CQ_95"
      id="FNanchor_CQ_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_CQ_95" class="fnanchor">[CQ]</a>
      and ther be sould, both ship, goods, and ordenance; and had, for this end,
      had speech with a factore of those parts, beforehand, to whom she should
      have been consigned. But this was prevented at this time, (after it was
      known,) partly by y<sup>e</sup> contrary advice given by their freinds
      hear to M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley, showing
      how it might insnare their friends in England, (being men of estate,) if
      it should come to be knowne; and for y<sup>e</sup> plantation, they did
      and would disalow it, and protest against it; and partly by their bad
      viage, for they both came too late to doe any good for fishing, and allso
      had such a wicked and drunken company as neither M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton
      nor any els could rule; as M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley, to his great greefe
      &amp; shame, saw, &amp; beheld, and all others that came nere them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ashley likwise was taken in a trape, (before M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley
      returned,) for trading powder &amp; shote with y<sup>e</sup> Indeans; and
      was ceased upon by some in authoritie, who allso would have confiscated
      above a thousand weight of beaver; but y<sup>e</sup> goods were freed, for
      y<sup>e</sup> Governer here made it appere, by a bond under Ashleys hand,
      wherin he was bound to them in 500<sup>li</sup>. not to trade any munition
      with the Indeans, or other wise <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328"
      id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>to abuse him selfe; it was also manifest
      against him that he had com&#773;ited uncleannes with Indean women,
      (things that they feared at his first imployment, which made them take
      this strict course with him in y<sup>e</sup> begining); so, to be shorte,
      they gott their goods freed, but he was sent home prisoner. And that I may
      make an end concerning him, after some time of imprisonmente in y<sup>e</sup>
      Fleet, by y<sup>e</sup> means of friends he was set at liberty, and
      intended to come over againe, but y<sup>e</sup> Lord prevented it; for he
      had a motion made to him, by some marchants, to goe into Russia, because
      he had such good skill in y<sup>e</sup> beaver trade, the which he
      accepted of, and in his returne home was cast away at sea; this was his
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley, fully understanding y<sup>e</sup> state of all
      things, had good satisfaction, and could well informe them how all things
      stood betweene M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton and y<sup>e</sup> plantation. Yea,
      he found that M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton had gott within him, and [180] got
      all the goods into his owne hands, for which M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley
      stood joyntly ingaged to them hear, aboute y<sup>e</sup> ship-Fre&#299;dship,
      as also most of y<sup>e</sup> fraigte money, besids some of his owne
      perticuler estate; about w<sup>ch</sup> more will appear here after. So he
      returned into England, and they sente a good quantity of beaver with him
      to y<sup>e</sup> rest of y<sup>e</sup> partners; so both he and it was
      very wellcome unto them.
    </p>
    <p>
      M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton followed his affaires, &amp; returned with his
      White Angell, being no more imployed by y<sup>e</sup> plantation; <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>but these
      bussinesses were not ended till many years after, nor well understood of a
      longe time, but foulded up in obscuritie, &amp; kepte in y<sup>e</sup>
      clouds, to y<sup>e</sup> great loss &amp; vexation of y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation, who in y<sup>e</sup> end were (for peace sake) forced to bear
      y<sup>e</sup> unjust burthen of them, to their allmost undoing, as will
      appear, if God give life to finish this history.

      Allerton had discharged them of y<sup>e</sup> Friendships accounte, and
      that they boath affirmed y<sup>t</sup> the White-Angell did not at all

      This year John Billinton y<sup>e</sup> elder (one that came over with y<sup>e</sup>

      Ashley being thus by y<sup>e</sup> hand of God taken away, and M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton discharged of his imploymente for them, their bussines began
      againe to rune in one chanell, and them selves better able to guide the
      same, Penobscote being wholy now at their disposing. And though M<sup>r</sup>.
      William Peirce had a parte ther as is before noted, yet now, as things
      stood, he was glad to have his money repayed him, and stand out. M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winslow, whom they had sent over, sent them over some supply as soone as
      he could; and afterwards when he came, which was something longe by reason
      of bussines, he brought a large supply of suitable goods with him, by
      which ther trading was well carried on. But by no means either he, or y<sup>e</sup>

        S<sup>r</sup>: It fell out by Gods providence, y<sup>t</sup> I received

        Bristoll, to London; and doe much feare what will be y<sup>e</sup> event
        of things. M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton intended to prepare y<sup>e</sup>
        ship againe, to set forth upon fishing. M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley, M<sup>r</sup>.
        Beachamp, &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews, they renounce all perticulers,
        protesting but for us they <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334"

        those parts; M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley stands inclinable to either. And
        wheras you write that he and M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton have taken y<sup>e</sup>
        Whit-Angell upon them, for their partners here, they professe they
        neiver gave any such order, nor will make it good; if them selves will
        cleare y<sup>e</sup> accounte &amp; doe it, all shall be well. What y<sup>e</sup>

        have tould you what I heard so peremtorly reported (which report I
        offered now to prove at Bristoll), I should have been unworthy my
        imploymente. And concerning y<sup>e</sup> commission so long since given
        to M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton, the truth is, the thing we feared is come
        upon us; for M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley &amp; y<sup>e</sup> rest have it,
        and will not deliver it, that being y<sup>e</sup> ground of our agents

      The comission above said was given by them under their hand and seale,
      when M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton was first imployed by them, and redemanded of
      him in y<sup>e</sup> year 29. when they begane to suspecte his course. He
      tould them it was amongst his papers, but he would seeke it out &amp; give
      it them before he wente. But he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335"
      id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>being ready to goe, it was demanded againe.
      He said he could not find it, but it was amongst his papers, which he must
      take w<sup>th</sup> him, [183] and he would send it by y<sup>e</sup> boat
      from y<sup>e</sup> eastward; but ther it could not be had neither, but he
      would seeke it up at sea. But whether M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley had it before
      or after, it is not certaine; but having it, he would not let it goe, but
      keeps it to this day. Wherfore, even amongst freinds, men had need be
      carfull whom they trust, and not lett things of this nature lye long
      unrecaled.

        Sir: Yours I have received by our loving friends, M<sup>r</sup>.
        Allerton &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley, who, blesed be God, after a
        long &amp; dangerous passage with y<sup>e</sup> ship Angell, are safely
        come to Bristoll. M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley is come up, but M<sup>r</sup>.
        Allerton I have not yet seen. We thanke you, and are very glad you have
        disswaded him from his Spanish viage, and y<sup>t</sup> he did not goe
        on in these designes he intended; for we did all uterly dislick of that
        course, as allso of y<sup>e</sup> fishing y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup>
        Freindship should have performed; for we wished him to sell y<sup>e</sup>
        salte, and were unwilling to have him undertake so much bussines, partly
        for y<sup>e</sup> ill success we formerly had in those affairs, and
        partly being loath to disburse so much money. But he perswaded us this
        must be one way y<sup>t</sup> must repay us, for y<sup>e</sup>
        plantation would be long in doing of it; ney, to my rememberance, he
        doubted you could not be able, with y<sup>e</sup> trade ther, to
        maintaine your charge &amp; pay us. And for this very cause he brought
        us on y<sup>t</sup> bussines with Ed: Ashley, for he was a stranger to
        us, &amp;c.

        thing, but what your agent perswaded us to, &amp; you by your letters
        desired. If he exceede your order, I hope you will not blame us, much
        less cast us of, when our moneys be layed out, &amp;c. But I fear
        neither you nor we have been well delte withall, for sure, as you write,
        halfe 4000<sup>li</sup>.?, nay, a quarter, in fitting comodities, and in
        seasonable time, would have furnished you beter then you were. And yet
        for all this, and much more I might write, I dare not but thinke him
        honest, and that his desire and intente was good; but y<sup>e</sup>
        wisest may faile. Well, now y<sup>t</sup> it hath pleased God to give us

        Winslow's returne. Now I should come to answer more perticulerly your
        letter, but herin I shall be very breefe. The coming of y<sup>e</sup>
        White Angele on your accounte could not be more strang to you, then y<sup>e</sup>
        buying of her was to us; for you gave him commission<a

        would stand too; we gave him none, and yet for his credite, and your
        saks, payed what bills he charged on us, &amp;c. For y<sup>t</sup> I
        write she was to acte tow parts, fishing &amp; trade; beleeve me, I
        never so much as thought of any perticuler trade, nor will side with any

        We purpose to keep y<sup>e</sup> Freindship and y<sup>e</sup> Whit

        As for y<sup>e</sup> White Angell, though we layed out y<sup>e</sup>
        money, and tooke bills of salle in our owne names, yet none of us had so
        much as a thought (I dare say) of deviding from you in any thing this

        take notice of any breach betwixte M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton and you, and

        We have now let him y<sup>e</sup> ship at 30<sup>li</sup>. p<sup>r</sup>
        month, by charter-partie, and bound him in a bond of a 1000<sup>li</sup>.
        to performe covenants, and bring her to London (if God please). And what
        he brings in her for you, shall be marked w<sup>th</sup> your marke, and
        bils of laden taken, &amp; sent in M<sup>r</sup>. Winslows letter, who
        is this day riding to Bristoll about it. So in this viage, we deale
        &amp; are with him as strangers. He hath brought in 3. books of
        accounts, one for y<sup>e</sup> company, an other for Ashley's bussines,
        and y<sup>e</sup> third for y<sup>e</sup> Whit-Angell and Freindship.
        The books, or coppies, we purpose to send you, for you may discover y<sup>e</sup>
        errours in them better then we. We can make it appear how much money he
        hath had of us, and you can charg him with all y<sup>e</sup> beaver he
        hath had of you. The totall sume, as he hath put it, is 7103. 17. 1. Of
        this he hath expended, and given to Mr. Vines &amp; others, aboute 543<sup>li</sup>.
        ode money, and then by your books you will <span class="pagenum"><a

        We blese God, who put both you &amp; us in mind to send each to other,
        for verily had he rune on in that desperate &amp; chargable course one
        year more, we had not been able to suport him; nay, both he and we must
        have lyen in y<sup>e</sup> ditch, and sunck under y<sup>e</sup> burthen,
        &amp;c. Had ther been an orderly course taken, and your bussines better
        managed, assuredly (by y<sup>e</sup> blessing of God) you had been y<sup>e</sup>
        ablest plantation that, as we think, or know, hath been undertaken by
        Englishmen, &amp;c.

      Thus farr of these letters of M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley's.<a

    <p>
      [185] A few observations from y<sup>e</sup> former letters, and then I
      shall set downe the simple truth of y<sup>e</sup> things (thus in
      controversie betweene them), at least as farr as by any good evidence it
      could be made to appeare; and so laboure to be breefe in so tedious and
      intricate a bussines, which hunge in expostulation betweene them many
      years before y<sup>e</sup> same was ended. That though ther will be often
      occasion to touch these things about other passages, yet I shall not neede
      to be large therin; doing it hear once for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, it seemes to appere clearly that Ashley's bussines, and y<sup>e</sup>
      buying of this ship, and y<sup>e</sup> courses <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>framed ther upon, were first
      contrived and proposed by M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton, as also y<sup>t</sup>
      the pleaes and pretences which he made, of y<sup>e</sup> inablitie of y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation to repaye their moneys, &amp;c., and y<sup>e</sup> hops he gave
      them of doing it with profile, was more beleeved &amp; rested on by them
      (at least some of them) then any thing y<sup>e</sup> plantation did or
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is like, though M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton might thinke not to wrong y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation in y<sup>e</sup> maine, yet his owne gaine and private ends led
      him a side in these things: for it came to be knowne, and I have it in a
      letter under M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley's hand, that in y<sup>e</sup> first 2.
      or 3. years of his imploymente, he had cleared up 400<sup>li</sup>. and
      put it into a brew-house of M<sup>r</sup>. Colliers in London, at first
      under M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley's name, &amp;c.; besids what he might have
      other wise. Againe, M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley and he had perticuler dealings
      in some things; for he bought up y<sup>e</sup> beaver that sea-men &amp;
      other passengers brought over to Bristoll, and at other places, and
      charged y<sup>e</sup> bills to London, which M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley payed;
      and they got some time 50<sup>li</sup>. a peece in a bargen, as was made
      knowne by M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley &amp; others, besids what might be
      other wise; which might make M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley harken unto him in
      many things; and yet I beleeve, as he in his forementioned leter write, he
      never would side in any perticuler trade w<sup>ch</sup> he conceived would
      wrong y<sup>e</sup> plantation, and eate up &amp; destroy y<sup>e</sup>
      generall.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      3<sup>ly</sup>. It may be perceived that, seeing they had done so much for
      y<sup>e</sup> plantation, both in former adventures and late
      disbursements, and allso that M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton was y<sup>e</sup>
      first occasioner of bringing them upon these new designes, which at first
      seemed faire &amp; profitable unto them, and unto which they agreed; but
      now, seeing them to turne to loss, and decline to greater intanglments,
      they thought it more meete for y<sup>e</sup> plantation to bear them, then
      them selves, who had borne much in other things allready, and so tooke
      advantage of such comission &amp; power as M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton had
      formerly had as their agente, to devolve these things upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      4<sup>ly</sup>. With pitie and compassion (touching M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton) I may say with y<sup>e</sup> apostle to Timothy, 1. Tim. 6. 9.
      <i>They that will be rich fall into many temtations and snares, &amp;c.,
      and pearce them selves throw with many sorrows, &amp;c.; for the love of
      money is y<sup>e</sup> roote of all evill</i>, v. 10. God give him to see
      y<sup>e</sup> evill in his failings, that he may find mercie by repentance
      for y<sup>e</sup> wrongs he hath done to any, and this pore plantation in
      spetiall. They that doe such things doe not only bring them selves into
      snares, and sorrows, but many with them, (though in an other kind,) as
      lamentable experience shows; and is too manifest in this bussines.
    </p>
    <p>
      [186] Now about these ships &amp; their setting forth, the truth, as farr
      as could be learned, is this. The motion aboute setting forth y<sup>e</sup>
      fishing ship (caled y<sup>e</sup> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342"
      id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>Frindship) came first from y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation, and y<sup>e</sup> reasons of it, as is before remembered; but
      wholy left to them selves to doe or not to doe, as they saw cause. But
      when it fell into consideration, and y<sup>e</sup> designe was held to be
      profitable and hopefull, it was propounded by some of them, why might not
      they doe it of them selves, seeing they must disburse all y<sup>e</sup>
      money, and what need they have any refferance to y<sup>e</sup> plantation
      in y<sup>t</sup>; they might take y<sup>e</sup> profile them selves,
      towards other losses, &amp; need not let y<sup>e</sup> plantation share
      therin; and if their ends were other wise answered for their supplyes to
      come too them in time, it would be well enough. So they hired her, &amp;
      set her out, and fraighted her as full as she could carry with passengers
      goods y<sup>t</sup> belonged to y<sup>e</sup> Massachussets, which rise to
      a good sume of money; intending to send y<sup>e</sup> plantations supply
      in y<sup>e</sup> other ship. The effecte of this M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley
      not only declared afterward upon occasion, but affirmed upon othe, taken
      before y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> &amp; Dep: Gov<sup>r</sup> of the
      Massachusets, M<sup>r</sup>. Winthrop &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Dudley: That
      this ship-Frindship was not sett out nor intended for y<sup>e</sup> joynt
      partnership of y<sup>e</sup> plantation, but for y<sup>e</sup> perticuler
      accounte of M<sup>r</sup>. James Sherley, M<sup>r</sup>. Beachampe, M<sup>r</sup>.
      Andrews, M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton, &amp; him selfe. This deposition was
      taken at Boston y<sup>e</sup> 29. of Aug: 1639. as is to be seen under
      their hands; besids some other concurente testimonies declared at severall
      times to sundrie of them.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      About y<sup>e</sup> Whit-Angell, though she was first bought, or at least
      the price beaten, by M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton (at Bristoll), yet that had
      been nothing if M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley had not liked it, and disbursed y<sup>e</sup>
      money. And that she was not intended for y<sup>e</sup> plantation appears
      by sundrie evidences;<a name="FNanchor_CZ_104" id="FNanchor_CZ_104"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_CZ_104" class="fnanchor">[CZ]</a> as, first, y<sup>e</sup>
      bills of sale, or charter-parties, were taken in their owne names, without
      any mention or refferance to y<sup>e</sup> plantation at all; viz. M<sup>r</sup>.
      Sherley, M<sup>r</sup>. Beachampe, M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews, M<sup>r</sup>.
      Denison, and M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton; for M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley fell
      off, and would not joyne with them in this. That she was not bought for
      their accounte, M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley tooke his oath before y<sup>e</sup>
      parties afforesaid, y<sup>e</sup> day and year above writen.
    </p>
    <p>
      M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton tooke his oath to like effecte concerning this
      ship, the Whit-Angell, before y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> &amp; Deputie,
      the 7. of Sep: 1639. and likewise deposed, y<sup>e</sup> same time, that M<sup>r</sup>.
      Hatherley and him selfe did, in the behalfe of them selves and y<sup>e</sup>
      said M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley, M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews, &amp; M<sup>r</sup>.
      Beachamp, agree and undertake to discharge, and save harmless, all y<sup>e</sup>
      rest of y<sup>e</sup> partners &amp; purchasers, of and from y<sup>e</sup>
      said losses of Freindship for 200<sup>li</sup>., which was to be
      discounted therupon; as by ther depossitions (which are in writing) may
      appeare more at large, and some other depositions &amp; other <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>testemonies
      by M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow,<a name="FNanchor_DA_105" id="FNanchor_DA_105"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_DA_105" class="fnanchor">[DA]</a> &amp;c. But I suppose
      these may be sufficente to evince the truth in these things, against all
      pretences to y<sup>e</sup> contrary. And yet the burthen lay still upon y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation; or, to speake more truly and rightly, upon those few that were
      ingaged for all, for they were faine to wade through these things without
      any help from any.
    </p>
    <p>
      [187] Concerning M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton's accounts, they were so larg and
      intrecate, as they could not well understand them, much less examine &amp;
      correcte them, without a great deale of time &amp; help, and his owne
      presence, which was now hard to gett amongst them; and it was 2. or 3.
      years before they could bring them to any good pass, but never make them
      perfecte. I know not how it came to pass, or what misterie was in it, for
      he tooke upon him to make up all accounts till this time, though M<sup>r</sup>.
      Sherley was their agente to buy &amp; sell their goods, and did more then
      he therin; yet he past in accounts in a maner for all disbursments, both
      concerning goods bought, which he never saw, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>but were done when he was
      hear in y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie or at sea; and all y<sup>e</sup> expences of
      y<sup>e</sup> Leyden people, done by others in his absence; the charges
      aboute y<sup>e</sup> patente, &amp;c. In all which he made them debtore to
      him above 300<sup>li</sup>. and demanded paimente of it. But when things
      came to scaning, he was found above 2000<sup>li</sup>. debtore to them,
      (this wherin M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley &amp; he being joyntly ingaged,
      which he only had, being included,) besids I know not how much y<sup>t</sup>
      could never be cleared; and interest moneys which ate them up, which he
      never accounted. Also they were faine to alow such large bills of charges
      as were intolerable; the charges of y<sup>e</sup> patent came to above 500<sup>li</sup>.
      and yet nothing done in it but what was done at first without any
      confirmation; 30<sup>li</sup>. given at a clape, and 50<sup>li</sup>.
      spent in a journey. No marvell therfore if M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley said in
      his leter, if their bussines had been better managed, they might have been
      y<sup>e</sup> richest plantation of any English at y<sup>t</sup> time.
      Yea, he scrued up his poore old father in law's accounte to above 200<sup>li</sup>.
      and brought it on y<sup>e</sup> generall accounte, and to befreind him
      made most of it to arise out of those goods taken up by him at Bristoll,
      at 50. per cent., because he knew they would never let it lye on y<sup>e</sup>
      old man, when, alass! he, poore man, never dreamte of any such thing, nor
      y<sup>t</sup> what he had could arise nere y<sup>t</sup> valew; but
      thought that many of them had been freely bestowed on him &amp; his
      children by M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton. Nither in truth did they come nere y<sup>t</sup>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>valew
      in worth, but y<sup>t</sup> sume was blowne up by interest &amp; high
      prises, which y<sup>e</sup> company did for y<sup>e</sup> most parte bear,
      (he deserving farr more,) being most sory that he should have a name to
      have much, when he had in effecte litle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year also M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley sent over an accounte, which was in
      a maner but a cash accounte what M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton had had of them,
      and disbursed, for which he referd to his accounts; besids an account of
      beaver sould, which M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow &amp; some others had carried
      over, and a large supply of goods which M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow had sent
      &amp; brought over, all which was comprised in that accounte, and all y<sup>e</sup>
      disbursments aboute y<sup>e</sup> Freindship, &amp; Whit-Angell, and what
      concerned their accounts from first to last; or any thing else he could
      charg y<sup>e</sup> partners with. So they were made debtor in y<sup>e</sup>
      foote of that accounte 4770<sup>li</sup> 19. 2.<a name="FNanchor_DB_106"
      id="FNanchor_DB_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_DB_106" class="fnanchor">[DB]</a>
      besids 1000<sup>li</sup>. still due for y<sup>e</sup> purchase yet
      unpayed; notwithstanding all y<sup>e</sup> beaver, and returnes that both
      Ashley &amp; they had made, which were not small.
    </p>
    <p>
      [188] In these accounts of M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley's some things were
      obscure, and some things twise charged, as a 100. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>of Bastable ruggs which came
      in y<sup>e</sup> Freindship, &amp; cost 75<sup>li</sup>., charged before
      by M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton, and now by him againe, with other perticulers
      of like nature doubtfull, to be twise or thrise charged; as also a sume of
      600<sup>li</sup>. which M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton deneyed, and they could
      never understand for what it was. They sent a note of these &amp; such
      like things afterward to M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley by M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow;
      but (I know not how it came to pass) could never have them explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into these deepe sumes had M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton rune them in tow years,
      for in y<sup>e</sup> later end of y<sup>e</sup> year 1628. all their debts
      did not amounte to much above 400<sup>li</sup>., as was then noted; and
      now come to so many thousands. And wheras in y<sup>e</sup> year 1629. M<sup>r</sup>.
      Sherley &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley being at Bristoll, and write a
      large letter from thence, in which they had given an account of y<sup>e</sup>
      debts, and what sumes were then disbursed, M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton never
      left begging &amp; intreating of them till they had put it out. So they
      bloted out 2. lines in y<sup>t</sup> leter in which y<sup>e</sup> sumes
      were contained, and write upon it so as not a word could be perceived; as
      since by them was confessed, and by y<sup>e</sup> leters may be seene. And
      thus were they kept hoodwinckte, till now they were so deeply ingaged. And
      wheras M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley did so ernestly press y<sup>t</sup> M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton might be sent over to finish y<sup>e</sup> great bussines aboute
      y<sup>e</sup> patente, as may be seen in his leter write 1629. as is
      before recorded, and y<sup>t</sup> they should be ernest w<sup>th</sup>
      his wife to suffer him <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348"
      id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>to goe, &amp;c., he hath since confessed by
      a letter under my hands, that it was M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton's owne
      doings, and not his, and he made him write his words, &amp; not his owne.
      The patent was but a pretence, and not y<sup>e</sup> thing. Thus were they
      abused in their simplicitie, and no beter then bought &amp; sould, as it
      may seeme.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to mend y<sup>e</sup> matter, M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton doth in a sorte
      wholy now deserte them; having brought them into y<sup>e</sup> briers, he
      leaves them to gett out as they can. But God crost him mightily, for he
      having hired y<sup>e</sup> ship of M<sup>r</sup>. Sherly at 30<sup>li</sup>.,
      a month, he set forth againe with a most wicked and drunken crue, and for
      covetousnes sake did so over lade her, not only filling her hould, but so
      stufed her betweene decks, as she was walte, and could not bear sayle, and
      they had like to have been cast away at sea, and were forced to put for
      Millford Havene, and new-stow her, &amp; put some of ther ordnance &amp;
      more heavie goods in y<sup>e</sup> botome; which lost them time, and made
      them come late into y<sup>e</sup> countrie, lose ther season, and made a
      worse viage then y<sup>e</sup> year before. But being come into y<sup>e</sup>
      countrie, he sells trading comodities to any y<sup>t</sup> will buy, to y<sup>e</sup>
      great prejudice of y<sup>e</sup> plantation here; but that which is worse,
      what he could not sell, he trustes; and sets up a company of base felows
      and maks them traders, to rune into every hole, &amp; into y<sup>e</sup>
      river of Kenebeck, to gleane away y<sup>e</sup> trade from y<sup>e</sup>
      house ther, aboute y<sup>e</sup> patente &amp; priviledge wherof he had
      dasht away so <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>much
      money of theirs here; [189] and now what in him lay went aboute to take
      away y<sup>e</sup> benefite therof, and to overthrow them. Yea, not only
      this, but he furnishes a company, and joyns with some consorts, (being now
      deprived of Ashley at Penobscote,) and sets up a trading house beyoned
      Penobscote, to cute of y<sup>e</sup> trade from thence also. But y<sup>e</sup>
      French perceiving that that would be greatly to their damage allso, they
      came in their begining before they were well setled, and displanted them,
      slue 2. of their men, and tooke all their goods to a good valew, y<sup>e</sup>
      loss being most, if not all, M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton's; for though some of
      them should have been his partners, yet he trusted them for their partes;
      the rest of y<sup>e</sup> men were sent into France, and this was the end
      of y<sup>t</sup> projecte. The rest of those he trusted, being lose and
      drunken fellows, did for y<sup>e</sup> most parte but coussen &amp; cheate
      him of all they got into their hands; that howsoever he did his friends
      some hurte hereby for y<sup>e</sup> presente, yet he gate litle good, but
      wente by y<sup>e</sup> loss by Gods just hand. After in time, when he came
      to Plim&#773;oth, y<sup>e</sup> church caled him to accounte for these,
      and other his grosse miscarrages; he confessed his faulte, and promised
      better walking, and that he would wind him selfe out of these courses as
      soone as he could, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year also Mr. Sherley would needs send them over a new-acountante; he
      had made mention of such a thing y<sup>e</sup> year before, but they write
      him word, that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>their
      charge was great allready, and they neede not increase it, as this would;
      but if they were well delte with, and had their goods well sent over, they
      could keep their accounts hear them selves. Yet he now sente one, which
      they did not refuse, being a yonger brother of M<sup>r</sup>. Winslows,
      whom they had been at charge to instructe at London before he came. He
      came over in the White Angell with M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton, and ther
      begane his first imploymente; for though M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley had so
      farr befreinded Mr. Allerton, as to cause<a name="FNanchor_DC_107"
      id="FNanchor_DC_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_DC_107" class="fnanchor">[DC]</a>
      M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow to ship y<sup>e</sup> supply sente to y<sup>e</sup>
      partners here in this ship, and give him 4<sup>li</sup>. p&#818;er tune,
      wheras others carried for 3. and he made them pay their fraight ready
      downe, before y<sup>e</sup> ship wente out of y<sup>e</sup> harbore,
      wheras others payed upon certificate of y<sup>e</sup> goods being
      delivered, and their fraight came to upward of 6. score pounds, yet they
      had much adoe to have their goods delivered, for some of them were
      chainged, as bread &amp; pease; they were forced to take worse for better,
      neither could they ever gett all. And if Josias Winslow had not been ther,
      it had been worse; for he had y<sup>e</sup> invoyce, and order to send
      them to y<sup>e</sup> trading houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year their house at Penobscott was robed by y<sup>e</sup> French, and
      all their goods of any worth they carried away, to y<sup>e</sup> value of
      400. or 500<sup>li</sup>. as y<sup>e</sup> cost first peny worth; in
      beaver 300<sup>li</sup>. waight; and y<sup>e</sup> rest in trading <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>goods, as
      coats, ruggs, blankett, biskett, &amp;c. It was in this maner. The m<sup>r</sup>.
      of y<sup>e</sup> house, and parte of y<sup>e</sup> company with him, were
      come with their vessell to y<sup>e</sup> westward to fecth a supply of
      goods which was brought over for them. In y<sup>e</sup> mean time comes a

      and desired they might hale her a shore and stop their leaks. And many
      French complements they used, and congees they made; and in y<sup>e</sup>

      this Scoth-man understanding that y<sup>e</sup> maister &amp; ye rest of y<sup>e</sup>

      muskets, that lay upon racks by y<sup>e</sup> wall side, and tooke them
      downe to looke on them, asking if they were charged. And when they were
      possesst of them, one presents a peece ready charged against y<sup>e</sup>

      Christopher Gardener, being, as him selfe said, descended of y<sup>t</sup>
      house y<sup>t</sup> the Bishop of Winchester came of (who was so great a
      persecutor of Gods saincts in Queene Maries days), and being a great
      traveler, received his first honour of knighthood at Jerusalem, being made
      Knight of y<sup>e</sup> Sepulcher ther. He came into these parts under
      pretence of forsaking y<sup>e</sup> world, and to live a private life, in
      a godly course, not unwilling to put him selfe upon any meane imployments,
      and take any paines for his living; and some time offered him selfe to
      joyne to y<sup>e</sup> churchs in sundry places. He brought over with him
      a servante or 2. and a comly yonge woman, whom be caled his cousin, but it
      was suspected, she (after y<sup>e</sup> Italian maner) was his concubine.
      Living at y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, for some miscariages which he should
      have answered, he fled away from authority, and gott amonge y<sup>e</sup>
      Indeans of these parts; they sent after him, but could not gett him, and
      promissed some reward to those y<sup>t</sup> should find him. The Indeans
      came to y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> here, and tould wher he was, and
      asked if they might kill him; he tould them no, by no means, but if they
      could take him and bring him hither, they should be payed for their
      paines. They said he had a gune &amp; a rapier, &amp; he would kill them
      if y<sup>ey</sup> went aboute it; and y<sup>e</sup> <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>Massachuset Indeans said
      they might kille him. But y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> tould them no,
      they should not kill him, but watch their opportunitie, &amp; take him.
      And so they did, for when they light of him by a river side, he got into a
      canowe to get from them, &amp; when they came nere him, whilst he
      presented his peece at them to keep them of, the streame carried y<sup>e</sup>
      canow against a rock, and tumbled both him &amp; his peece &amp; rapier
      into y<sup>e</sup> water; yet he got out, and having a litle dagger by his
      side, they durst not close with him, but getting longe pols they soone
      beat his dagger out of his hand, so he was glad to yeeld; and they brought
      him to y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>. But his hands and armes were swolen
      &amp; very sore with y<sup>e</sup> blowes they had given him. So he used
      him kindly, &amp; sent him to a lodging wher his armes were bathed and
      anoynted, and he was quickly well againe, and blamed y<sup>e</sup> Indeans
      for beating him so much. They said that they did but a litle whip him with
      sticks. In his lodging, those y<sup>t</sup> made his bed found a litle
      note booke that by accidente had slipt out of his pockett, or some private
      place, in which was a memoriall what day he was reconciled to y<sup>e</sup>
      pope &amp; church of Rome, and in what universitie he tooke his scapula,
      and such &amp; such degrees. It being brought to y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>,
      he kept it, and sent y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> of y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachusets word of his taking, who sent for him. So y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
      sent him and these notes to y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> ther, who tooke
      it very thankfuly; but after he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354"

        Wheras his Ma<sup>tie</sup> hath latly been informed of great

        suffered to rune on, would tende to y<sup>e</sup> great dishonour of
        this kingdome, and utter ruine of that plantation. For prevention
        wherof, and for y<sup>e</sup> orderly settling of goverment, according
        to y<sup>e</sup> intention of those patents which have been granted by
        his Ma<sup>tie</sup> and from his late royall father king James, it hath
        pleased his Ma<sup>tie</sup> that y<sup>e</sup> lords &amp; others of

        consideration. Their lordships in y<sup>e</sup> first place thought fitt
        to make a comitie of this bord, to take examination of y<sup>e</sup>
        matters informed; which comitties having called diverse of y<sup>e</sup>
        principall adventurers in y<sup>t</sup> plantation, and heard those that
        are complanants against them, most of the things informed being deneyed,
        and resting to be proved by parties that must be called from y<sup>t</sup>

        if y<sup>e</sup> adventurers should have discouragmente, or take
        suspition that the state hear had no good opinion of y<sup>t</sup>
        plantation; their lordships, not laying the faulte or fancies (if any

      M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton, returning for England, litle regarded his bound
      of a 1000<sup>li</sup>. to performe covenants; for wheras he was bound by
      y<sup>e</sup> same to bring y<sup>e</sup> ship to [190] London, and to pay
      30<sup>li</sup>. per month for her hire, he did neither of boath, for he
      carried her to Bristoll againe, from whence he intended to sett her out
      againe, and so did y<sup>e</sup> 3. time, into these parts (as after will
      appear); and though she had been 10. months upon y<sup>e</sup> former
      viage, at 30<sup>li</sup>. p&#818;<sup>r</sup> month, yet he never payed
      peney for hire. It should seeme he knew well enough how to deale with M<sup>r</sup>.
      Sherley. And M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley, though he would needs tye her &amp;
      her accounte upon y<sup>e</sup> generall, yet he would dispose of her as
      him selfe pleased; for though M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow had in their names
      protested against y<sup>e</sup> receiving her on y<sup>t</sup> accounte,
      or if <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>ever
      they should hope to preveile in shuch a thing, yet never to suffer M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton to have any more to doe in her, yet he y<sup>e</sup> last year
      let her wholy unto him, and injoyned them to send all their supplye in her
      to their prejudice, as is before noted. And now, though he broke his
      bonds, kepte no covenante, paid no hire, nor was ever like to keep
      covenants, yet now he goes and sells him all, both ship, &amp; all her
      accounts, from first to last (and in effecte he might as well have given
      him y<sup>e</sup> same); and not only this, but he doth as good as provide
      a sanctuary for him, for he gives him one years time to prepare his
      accounte, and then to give up y<sup>e</sup> same to them here; and then
      another year for him to make paymente of what should be due upon y<sup>t</sup>
      accounte. And in y<sup>e</sup> mean time writs ernestly to them not to
      interupte or hinder him from his bussines, or stay him aboute clearing
      accounts, &amp;c.; so as he in y<sup>e</sup> mean time gathers up all
      monies due for fraighte, and any other debtes belonging either to her, or
      y<sup>e</sup> Frindship's accounts, as his owne perticuler; and after,
      sells ship, &amp; ordnans, fish, &amp; what he had raised, in Spaine,
      according to y<sup>e</sup> first designe, in effecte; and who had, or what
      became of y<sup>e</sup> money, he best knows. In y<sup>e</sup> mean time
      their hands were bound, and could doe nothing but looke on, till he had
      made all away into other mens hands (save a few catle &amp; a litle land
      &amp; some small maters he had here at Plimoth), and so in y<sup>e</sup>
      end removed, as he had allready his person, so all <span class="pagenum"><a

        White-Angell, which somewhat troubleth us, as I perceive it doth you.
        And now M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton beeing here, we have had some
        confferance with him about her, and find him very willing to give you
        &amp; us all contente y<sup>t</sup> possiblie he can, though he burthen
        him selfe. He is contente to take y<sup>e</sup> White-Angell wholy on
        him selfe, notwithstanding he mett with pirates nere y<sup>e</sup> coast
        of Ierland, which tooke away his best sayles &amp; other provissions
        from her; so as verily if we should now sell her, she would yeeld but a
        small price, besids her ordnance. And to set her forth againe with fresh
        money we would not, she being now at Bristoll. Wherfore we thought it
        best, both for you &amp; us, M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton being willing to
        take her, to accepte of his bond of tow thousand pounds, to give [191]

        pay you at 6. and 6. months after, what soever shall be due unto you and

        all y<sup>e</sup> disasters he hath had, I am perswaded he hath enough

        gather in what is due to him ther. I doe not write this slightly, but

      seals of some, it was but a trick, having gathered up an accounte of what

      Mr. Hatherley came over againe this year, but upon his owne occasions, and
      begane to make preparation to plant &amp; dwell in y<sup>e</sup> countrie.
      He with his former dealings had wound in what money he had in y<sup>e</sup>
      patnership into his owne hands, and so gave off all partnership (excepte
      in name), as was found in y<sup>e</sup> issue of things; neither did he
      medle, or take any care aboute y<sup>e</sup> same; only he was troubled
      about his ingagmente aboute y<sup>e</sup> Friendship, as will after
      appeare. And now partly aboute y<sup>t</sup> accounte, in some reconings
      betweene M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton and him, and some debts y<sup>t</sup> M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton otherwise owed him upon dealing between them in perticuler, he
      drue up an accounte of above 2000<sup>li</sup>., and would faine have
      ingaged y<sup>e</sup> partners here with it, because M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton had been their agent. But they <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>tould him they had been
      fool'd longe enough with such things, and shewed him y<sup>t</sup> it no
      way belonged to them; but tould him he must looke to make good his
      ingagment for y<sup>e</sup> Freindship, which caused some trouble betweene
      M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton and him.
    </p>
    <p>
      M<sup>r</sup>. William Peirce did y<sup>e</sup> like, M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allerton being wound into his debte also upon particuler dealings; as if
      they had been bound to make good all mens debts. But they easily shooke
      off these things. But M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton herby rane into much trouble
      &amp; vexation, as well as he had troubled others, for M<sup>r</sup>.
      Denison sued him for y<sup>e</sup> money he had disbursed for y<sup>e</sup>
      6. part of y<sup>e</sup> Whit-Angell, &amp; recovered y<sup>e</sup> same
      with damages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though y<sup>e</sup> partners were thus pl&#363;ged into great ingagments,
      &amp; oppresed with unjust debts, yet y<sup>e</sup> Lord prospered their
      trading, that they made yearly large returnes, and had soone wound them
      selves out of all, if yet they had otherwise been well delt with all; as

      cuntrie, espetially into y<sup>e</sup> Bay of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets;
      by which means corne &amp; catle rose to a great prise, by w<sup>ch</sup>
      many were much inriched, and com&#773;odities grue plentifull; and yet in
      other regards this benefite turned to their hurte, and this accession of
      strength to their weaknes. For now as their stocks increased, and y<sup>e</sup>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>increse
      vendible, ther was no longer any holding them togeather, but now they must
      of necessitie goe to their great lots; they could not other wise keep
      their katle; and having oxen growne, they must have land for plowing &amp;
      tillage. And no man now thought he could live, except he had catle and a
      great deale of ground to keep them; all striving to increase their stocks.
      By which means they were scatered all over y<sup>e</sup> bay, quickly, and
      y<sup>e</sup> towne, in which they lived compactly till now, was left very
      thine, and in a short time allmost desolate. And if this had been all, it
      had been less, thoug to much; but y<sup>e</sup> church must also be
      devided, and those y<sup>t</sup> had lived so long togeather in Christian
      &amp; comfortable fellowship must now part and suffer many divissions.
      First, those that lived on their lots on y<sup>e</sup> other side of the
      bay (called Duxberie) they could not long bring their wives &amp; children
      to y<sup>e</sup> publick worship &amp; church meetings here, but with such
      burthen, as, growing to some competente number, they sued to be dismissed
      and become a body of them selves; and so they were dismiste (about this
      time), though very unwillingly. But to touch this sadd matter, and handle
      things together that fell out afterward. To prevent any further scatering
      from this place, and weakning of y<sup>e</sup> same, it was thought best
      to give out some good farms to spetiall persons, y<sup>t</sup> would
      promise to live at Plimoth, and lickly to be helpfull to y<sup>e</sup>
      church or comonewelth, and so tye y<sup>e</sup> lands to <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>Plimoth
      as farmes for the same; and ther they might keepe their catle &amp;
      tillage by some servants, and retaine their dwellings here. And so some
      spetiall lands were granted at a place generall, called Greens Harbor,
      wher no allotments had been in y<sup>e</sup> former divission, a plase
      very weell meadowed, and fitt to keep &amp; rear catle, good store. But
      alass! this remedy proved worse then y<sup>e</sup> disease; for w<sup>th</sup>in
      a few years those that had thus gott footing ther rente them selves away,
      partly by force, and partly wearing y<sup>e</sup> rest with importunitie
      and pleas of necessitie, so as they must either suffer them to goe, or
      live in continuall opposition and contention. And others still, as y<sup>ey</sup>
      conceived them selves straitened, or to want accom&#773;odation, break
      away under one pretence or other, thinking their owne conceived
      necessitie, and the example of others, a warrente sufficente for them. And
      this, I fear, will be y<sup>e</sup> ruine of New-England, at least of y<sup>e</sup>
      churches of God ther, &amp; will provock y<sup>e</sup> Lords displeasure
      against them.

      [193] This year, M<sup>r</sup>. William Perce came into y<sup>e</sup>
      cuntry, &amp; brought goods and passengers, in a ship caled y<sup>e</sup>
      Lyon, which belonged cheefly to M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley, and y<sup>e</sup>
      rest of y<sup>e</sup> London partners, but these hear had nothing to doe
      with her. In this ship (besides beaver which they had sent home before)
      they sent upwards of 800<sup>li</sup>. in her, and some otter skines; and
      also y<sup>e</sup> coppies of M<sup>r</sup>. Allertons accounts, desiring
      that they would also peruse &amp; examene them, and rectifie shuch <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>things as
      they should find amise in them; and rather because they were better
      acquaynted with y<sup>e</sup> goods bought ther, and y<sup>e</sup>
      disbursments made, then they could bee here; yea, a great part were done
      by them selves, though M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton brougt in y<sup>e</sup>
      accounte, and sundry things seemed to them obscure and had need of
      clearing. Also they sente a booke of exceptions against his accounts, in
      such things as they could manifest, and doubted not but they might adde
      more therunto. And also shewed them how much M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton was
      debtor to y<sup>e</sup> accounte; and desired, seeing they had now put y<sup>e</sup>
      ship White-Angell, and all, wholy into his power, and tyed their hands
      here, that they could not call him to accounte for any thinge, till y<sup>e</sup>
      time was expired which they had given him, and by that time other men
      would get their debts of him, (as sume had done already by suing him,) and
      he would make all away here quickly out of their reach; and therfore
      prayed them to looke to things, and gett paymente of him ther, as it was
      all y<sup>e</sup> reason they should, seeing they keept all y<sup>e</sup>
      bonds &amp; covenants they made with him in their owne hands; and here
      they could doe nothing by y<sup>e</sup> course they had taken, nor had any
      thing to show if they should goe aboute it. But it pleased God, this ship,
      being first to goe to Verginia before she wente home, was cast away on y<sup>t</sup>
      coast, not farr from Virginia, and their beaver was all lost (which was y<sup>e</sup>
      first loss they sustained in that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365"
      id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>kind); but M<sup>r</sup>. Peirce &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
      men saved their lives, and also their leters, and gott into Virginia, and
      so safly home. Y<sup>e</sup> accounts were now sent from hence againe to
      them. And thus much of y<sup>e</sup> passages of this year.

        Dear freinds, &amp;c. Y<sup>e</sup> bruit of this fatall stroke that y<sup>e</sup>
        Lord hath brought both on me and you all will come to your ears before
        this com&#773;eth to your hands, (it is like,) and therfore I shall not
        need to inlarg in perticulers, &amp;c. My whole estate (for y<sup>e</sup>
        most parte) is taken away; and so yours, in a great measure, by this and
        your former losses [he means by y<sup>e</sup> French &amp; M<sup>r</sup>.
        Allerton]. It is time to looke aboute us, before y<sup>e</sup> wrath of
        y<sup>e</sup> Lord breake forth to utter destruction. The good Lord give
        us all grace to search our harts and trie our ways, and turne unto y<sup>e</sup>
        Lord, and humble our selves under his mightie hand, and seeke
        atonemente, &amp;c. Dear freinds, you may know y<sup>t</sup> all your
        beaver, and y<sup>e</sup> books of your accounts, are swallowed up in y<sup>e</sup>
        sea; your letters remaine with me, and shall be delivered, if God bring
        me home. But what should I more say? Have we lost our outward estates?
        yet a hapy loss if our soules may gaine; ther is yet more in y<sup>e</sup>
        Lord Jehova than ever we had yet in y<sup>e</sup> world. Oh that our

        certified you of y<sup>e</sup> great, &amp; uncomfortable, and
        unseasonable loss you &amp; we had, in y<sup>e</sup> loss of M<sup>r</sup>.
        Peirce his ship, y<sup>e</sup> Lyon; but y<sup>e</sup> Lords holy name
        be blessed, who gives &amp; taks as it pleaseth him; his will be done,
        Amen. I then related unto you y<sup>t</sup> fearfull accidente, or
        rather judgmente, y<sup>e</sup> Lord pleased to lay on London Bridge, by
        fire, and therin gave you a touch of my great loss; the Lord, I hope,
        will give me patience to bear it, and faith to trust in him, &amp; not
        in these slipery and uncertaine things of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton is nere upon sayle with you by this; but
        he had many disasters here before he could gett away; yet y<sup>e</sup>
        last was a heavie one; his ship, going out of y<sup>e</sup> harbor at
        Bristoll, by stormie weather was so farr driven on y<sup>e</sup> shore,
        as it cost him above 100<sup>li</sup>. before shee could be gott off
        againe. Verily his case was so lamentable as I could not but afford him
        some help therin (and so did some were strangers to him); besids, your
        goods were in her, and if he had not been supported, he must have broke
        off his viage, and so loss could not have been avoyded on all sides.
        When he first bought her, I thinke he had made a saving match, if he had
        then sunck her, and never set her forth. I hope he sees y<sup>e</sup>
        Lords hand against him, and will leave of these viages. I thinke we did
        well in parting with her; she would have been but a clogge to y<sup>e</sup>
        accounte from time to time, and now though we shall not gett much by way
        of satisfaction, yet we shall lose no more. And now, as before I have
        writte, I pray you finish all y<sup>e</sup> accounts and reconings with
        him there; for here <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368"
        id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>he hath nothing, but many debtes that he
        stands ingaged to many men for. Besids, here is not a man y<sup>t</sup>
        will spend a day, or scarce an hower, aboute y<sup>e</sup> accounts but
        my selfe, and y<sup>t</sup> bussines will require more time and help
        then I can afford. I shall not need to say any more; I hope you will doe
        y<sup>t</sup> which shall be best &amp; just, to which adde mercie, and
        consider his intente, though he failed in many perticulers, which now
        cannot be helped, &amp;c.
      </p>
      <p>
        To morrow, or next day at furthest, we are to pay 300<sup>li</sup>. and
        M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp is out of y<sup>e</sup> towne, yet y<sup>e</sup>
        bussines I must doe. Oh the greefe &amp; trouble y<sup>t</sup> man, M<sup>r</sup>.
        Allerton, hath brought upon you and us! I cannot forgett it, and to
        thinke on it draws many a sigh from my harte, and teares from my eyes.
        And now y<sup>e</sup> Lord hath visited me with an other great loss, yet
        I can undergoe it with more patience. But this I have follishly pulled
        upon my selfe, &amp;c. [And in another, he hath this passage:] By M<sup>r</sup>.
        Allertons faire propositions and large [195] promises, I have over rune
        my selfe; verily, at this time greefe hinders me to write, and tears
        will not suffer me to see; wherfore, as you love those that ever loved
        you, and y<sup>t</sup> plantation, thinke upon us. Oh what shall I say
        of that man, who hath abused your trust and wronged our loves! but now
        to complaine is too late, nither can I complaine of your backwardnes,
        for I am perswaded it lys as heavie on your harts, as it doth on our
        purses or credites. And had y<sup>e</sup> Lord sent M<sup>r</sup>.
        Peirce safe home, we had eased both you and us of some of those debts;
        the Lord I hope will give us patience to bear these crosses; and that
        great God, whose care &amp; providence is every where, and spetially
        over all those that desire truly to fear and serve him, direct, guid,
        prosper, &amp; blesse you so, as y<sup>t</sup> you may be able (as I
        perswade my selfe you are willing) to discharge &amp; take off this
        great &amp; heavie burthen which now lyes upon me for your saks; and I
        hope in y<sup>e</sup> ende for y<sup>e</sup> good of you, and many
        thousands <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>more;
        for had not you &amp; we joyned &amp; continued togeather, New-England
        might yet have been scarce knowne, I am perswaded, not so replenished
        &amp; inhabited with honest English people, as it now is. The Lord

      By this it apperes when M<sup>r</sup>. Sherly sould him y<sup>e</sup> ship
      &amp; all her accounts, it was more for M<sup>r</sup>. Allertons advantage
      then theirs; and if they could get any there, well &amp; good, for they
      were like to have nothing here. And what course was held to hinder them
      there, hath allready beene manifested. And though M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley
      became more sinsible of his owne condition, by these losses, and therby
      more sadly &amp; plainly to complaine of M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton, yet no
      course was taken to help them here, but all left unto them selves; not so
      much as to examene &amp; rectifie y<sup>e</sup> accounts, by which (it is
      like) some hundereds of pounds might have been taken off. But very
      probable it is, the more they saw was taken off, y<sup>e</sup> less might
      come unto them selves. But I leave these maters, &amp; come to other

      M<sup>r</sup>. Roger Williams (a man godly &amp; zealous, having many
      precious parts, but very unsettled in judgmente) came over first to y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachusets, but upon some discontente left y<sup>t</sup> place, and came
      hither, (wher he was fri&#275;dly entertained, according to their poore
      abilitie,) and exercised his gifts amongst them, &amp; after some <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>time was
      admitted a member of y<sup>e</sup> church; and his teaching well
      approoved, for y<sup>e</sup> benefite wherof I still blese God, and am
      thankfull to him, even for his sharpest admonitions &amp; reproufs, so
      farr as they agreed with truth. He this year begane to fall into some
      strang oppi&#299;ons, and from opinion to practise; which caused some
      controversie betweene y<sup>e</sup> church &amp; him, and in y<sup>e</sup>
      end some discontente on his parte, by occasion wherof he left them some
      thing abruptly. Yet after wards sued for his dismission to y<sup>e</sup>
      church of Salem, which was granted, with some caution to them concerning
      him, and what care they ought to have of him. But he soone fell into more
      things ther, both to their and y<sup>e</sup> governments troble and [196]
      disturbance. I shall not need to name perticulers, they are too well
      knowen now to all, though for a time y<sup>e</sup> church here wente under
      some hard censure by his occasion, from some that afterwards smarted them
      selves. But he is to be pitied, and prayed for, and so I shall leave y<sup>e</sup>
      matter, and desire y<sup>e</sup> Lord to shew him his errors, and reduse
      him into y<sup>e</sup> way of truth, and give him a setled judgment and
      constancie in y<sup>e</sup> same; for I hope he belongs to y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord, and y<sup>t</sup> he will shew him mercie.

      Having had formerly converse and famliarity with y<sup>e</sup> Dutch, (as
      is before remembred,) they, seeing them seated here in a barren quarter,
      tould them of a river called by them y<sup>e</sup> Fresh River, but now is
      known <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>by
      y<sup>e</sup> name of Conightecute-River, which they often com&#773;ended
      unto them for a fine place both for plantation and trade, and wished them
      to make use of it. But their hands being full otherwise, they let it pass.
      But afterwards ther coming a company of banishte Indeans into these parts,
      that were drivene out from thence by the potencie of y<sup>e</sup>
      Pequents, which usurped upon them, and drive them from thence, they often
      sollisited them to goe thither, and they should have much trad, espetially
      if they would keep a house ther. And having now good store of comodities,
      and allso need to looke out wher they could advantage them selves to help
      them out of their great ingagments, they now begane to send that way to
      discover y<sup>e</sup> same, and trade with y<sup>e</sup> natives. They
      found it to be a fine place, but had no great store of trade; but y<sup>e</sup>
      Indeans excused y<sup>e</sup> same in regard of y<sup>e</sup> season, and
      the fear y<sup>e</sup> Indans were in of their enemise. So they tried
      diverce times, not with out profite, but saw y<sup>e</sup> most certainty
      would be by keeping a house ther, to receive y<sup>e</sup> trad when it
      came down out of y<sup>e</sup> inland. These Indeans, not seeing them very
      forward to build ther, solisited them of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets in
      like sorte (for their end was to be restored to their countrie againe);
      but they in y<sup>e</sup> Bay being but latly come, were not fitte for y<sup>e</sup>
      same; but some of their cheefe made a motion to joyne w<sup>th</sup> the
      partners here, to trad joyntly with them in y<sup>t</sup> river, the which
      they were willing to imbrace, and so they <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>should have builte, and put
      in equall stock togeather. A time of meeting was appointed at y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachusets, and some of y<sup>e</sup> cheefe here was appointed to treat
      with them, and went accordingly; but they cast many fears of deanger &amp;
      loss and the like, which was perceived to be the maine obstacles, though
      they alledged they were not provided of trading goods. But those hear
      offered at presente to put in sufficiente for both, provided they would
      become ingaged for y<sup>e</sup> halfe, and prepare against y<sup>e</sup>
      nexte year. They conffessed more could not be offered, but thanked them,
      and tould them they had no mind to it. They then answered, they hoped it
      would be no offence unto [197] them, if them sellves wente on without
      them, if they saw it meete. They said ther was no reason they should; and
      thus this treaty broake of, and those here tooke conveniente time to made
      a begining ther; and were y<sup>e</sup> first English that both discovered
      that place, and built in y<sup>e</sup> same, though they were litle better
      then thrust out of it afterward as may appeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      But y<sup>e</sup> Dutch begane now to repente, and hearing of their
      purpose &amp; preparation, ind&#275;oured to prevente them, and gott in a
      litle before them, and made a slight forte, and planted 2. peeces of
      ordnance, thretening to stopp their passage. But they having made a smale
      frame of a house ready, and haveing a great new-barke, they stowed their
      frame in her hold, &amp; bords to cover &amp; finishe it, having nayles
      &amp; all other <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>provisions
      fitting for their use. This they did y<sup>e</sup> rather that they might
      have a presente defence against y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, who weare much
      offended that they brought home &amp; restored y<sup>e</sup> right Sachem
      of y<sup>e</sup> place (called Natawanute); so as they were to incounter
      with a duble danger in this attempte, both y<sup>e</sup> Dutch and y<sup>e</sup>
      Indeans. When they came up y<sup>e</sup> river, the Dutch demanded what
      they intended, and whither they would goe; they answered, up y<sup>e</sup>
      river to trade (now their order was to goe and seat above them). They bid
      them strike, &amp; stay, or els they would shoote them; &amp; stood by
      ther ordnance ready fitted. They answered they had com&#773;ission from y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> of Plimoth to goe up y<sup>e</sup> river to such a place,
      and if they did shoote, they must obey their order and proceede; they
      would not molest them, but would goe one. So they passed along, and though
      the Dutch threatened them hard, yet they shoot not. Com&#773;ing to their
      place, they clapt up their house quickly, and landed their provissions,
      and left y<sup>e</sup> companie appoynted, and sent the barke home; and
      afterwards palisadoed their house aboute, and fortified them selves
      better. The Dutch sent word home to y<sup>e</sup> Monhatas what was done:
      and in proces of time, they sent a band of aboute 70. men, in warrlike
      maner, with collours displayed, to assaulte them; but seeing them
      strengtened, &amp; that it would cost blood, they came to parley, and
      returned in peace. And this was their enterance ther, who deserved to have
      held it, and not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>by
      freinds to have been thrust out, as in a sorte they were, as will after
      appere. They did y<sup>e</sup> Dutch no wrong, for they took not a foote
      of any land they bought, but went to y<sup>e</sup> place above them, and
      bought that tracte of land which belonged to these Indeans which they
      carried with them, and their friends, with whom y<sup>e</sup> Dutch had
      nothing to doe. But of these matters more in another place.

      It pleased y<sup>e</sup> Lord to visite them this year with an infectious
      fevoure, of which many fell very sicke, and upward of 20. persons dyed,
      men and women, besids children, and sundry of them of their anciente
      friends which had lived in Holand; as Thomas Blossome, Richard Masterson,
      with sundry [198] others, and in y<sup>e</sup> end (after he had much
      helped others) Samuell Fuller, who was their surgeon &amp; phisition, and
      had been a great help and comforte unto them; as in his facultie, so
      otherwise, being a deacon of y<sup>e</sup> church, a man godly, and
      forward to doe good, being much missed after his death; and he and y<sup>e</sup>
      rest of their brethren much lamented by them, and caused much sadnes &amp;
      mourning amongst them; which caused them to humble them selves, &amp;
      seeke y<sup>e</sup> Lord; and towards winter it pleased the Lord y<sup>e</sup>
      sicknes ceased. This disease allso swept away many of y<sup>e</sup>
      Indeans from all y<sup>e</sup> places near adjoyning; and y<sup>e</sup>
      spring before, espetially all y<sup>e</sup> month of May, ther was such a
      quantitie of a great sorte of flies, like (for bignes) <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>to wasps,
      or bumble-bees, which came out of holes in y<sup>e</sup> ground, and
      replenished all y<sup>e</sup> woods, and eate y<sup>e</sup> green-things,
      and made such a constante yelling noyes, as made all y<sup>e</sup> woods
      ring of them, and ready to deafe y<sup>e</sup> hearers. They have not by y<sup>e</sup>
      English been heard or seen before or since. But y<sup>e</sup> Indeans
      tould them y<sup>t</sup> sicknes would follow, and so it did in June,
      July, August, and y<sup>e</sup> cheefe heat of som&#773;er.

      It pleased y<sup>e</sup> Lord to inable them this year to send home a
      great quantity of beaver, besids paing all their charges, &amp; debts at
      home, which good returne did much incourage their freinds in England. They
      sent in beaver 3366<sup>li</sup>. waight, and much of it coat beaver,
      which yeeled 20<sup>s</sup>. p&#818;<sup>r</sup> pound, &amp; some of it

      This year M<sup>r</sup>. Thomas Prence was chosen Gov<sup>r</sup>.

      M<sup>r</sup>. Sherleys letters were very breefe in answer of theirs this
      year. I will forbear to coppy any part therof, only name a head or 2.
      therm. First, he desirs they will take nothing ill in what he formerly
      write, professing his good affection towards them as before, &amp;c. 2<sup>ly</sup>.
      For M<sup>r</sup>. Allertons accounts, he is perswaded they must suffer,
      and y<sup>t</sup> in no small sum&#773;es; <span class="pagenum"><a

      enough to complaine, but it was now too late. And that he had failed them
      ther, those here, and him selfe in his owne aimes. And that now, having
      thus left them here, he feared God had or would leave him, and it would
      not be strang, but a wonder if he fell not into worse things, &amp;c. 3<sup>ly</sup>.
      He blesseth God and is thankfull to them for y<sup>e</sup> good returne
      made this year. This is y<sup>e</sup> effecte of his letters, other things
      being of more private nature.

      I am now to enter upon one of y<sup>e</sup> sadest things that befell them

    <p>
      Now it so fell out, that one Hocking, belonging to y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation of Pascataway, wente with a barke and com&#773;odities to trade
      in that river, and would needs press into their limites; and not only so,
      but would needs goe up y<sup>e</sup> river above their house, (towards y<sup>e</sup>
      falls of y<sup>e</sup> river,) and intercept the trade that should come to
      them. He that was cheefe of y<sup>e</sup> place forbad them, and prayed
      him that he would not offer them that injurie, nor goe aboute to infring
      their liberties, which had cost them so dear. But he answered he would goe
      up and trade ther in dispite of them, and lye ther as longe as he pleased.
      The other tould him he must then be forced to remove him from thence, or
      make seasure of him if he could. He bid him doe his worste, and so wente
      up, and anchored ther. The other tooke a boat &amp; some men &amp; went up
      to him, when he saw his time, and againe entreated him to departe by what
      perswasion he could. But all in vaine: he could gett nothing of him but
      ill words. So he considred that now was y<sup>e</sup> season for trade to
      come downe, and if he should suffer him to lye, &amp; take it from them,
      all ther former charge would be lost, and they had better throw up all.
      So, consulting <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>with
      his men, (who were willing thertoe,) he resolved to put him from his
      anchores, and let him drive downe y<sup>e</sup> river with y<sup>e</sup>
      streame; but com&#773;anded y<sup>e</sup> men y<sup>t</sup> none should
      shoote a shote upon any occasion, except he com&#773;anded them. He spoake
      to him againe, but all in vaine; then he sente a cuple in a canow to cutt
      his cable, the which one of them performes; but Hocking taks up a pece
      which he had layed ready, and as y<sup>e</sup> barke shered by y<sup>e</sup>
      canow, he shote [200] him close under her side, in y<sup>e</sup> head, (as
      I take it,) so he fell downe dead instantly. One of his fellows (that
      loved him well) could not hold, but with a muskett shot Hocking, who fell
      downe dead and never speake word. This was y<sup>e</sup> truth of y<sup>e</sup>
      thing. The rest of y<sup>e</sup> men carried home the vessell and y<sup>e</sup>
      sad tidings of these things. Now y<sup>e</sup> Lord Saye &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord Brooks, with some other great persons, had a hand in this plantation;
      they write home to them, as much as they could to exasperate them in y<sup>e</sup>
      matter, leaveing out all y<sup>e</sup> circomstances, as if he had been
      kild without any offenc of his parte, conceling y<sup>t</sup> he had kild
      another first, and y<sup>e</sup> just occasion that he had given in
      offering such wrong; at w<sup>ch</sup> their Lords<sup>ps</sup> were much
      offended, till they were truly informed of y<sup>e</sup> mater.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bruite of this was quickly carried all aboute, (and y<sup>t</sup> in y<sup>e</sup>
      worst maner,) and came into y<sup>e</sup> Bay to their neighbours their.
      Their owne barke com&#773;ing home, and bringing a true relation of y<sup>e</sup>
      matter, sundry <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>were
      sadly affected with y<sup>e</sup> thing, as they had cause. It was not
      long before they had occasion to send their vessell into y<sup>e</sup> Bay
      of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusetts; but they were so prepossest with this
      matter, and affected with y<sup>e</sup> same, as they com&#773;ited M<sup>r</sup>.
      Alden to prison, who was in y<sup>e</sup> bark, and had been at Kenebeck,
      but was no actore in y<sup>e</sup> bussines, but wente to carie them
      supply. They dismist y<sup>e</sup> barke aboute her bussines, but kept him
      for some time. This was thought strang here, and they sente Capten
      Standish to give them true information, (togeather with their letters,)
      and y<sup>e</sup> best satisfaction they could, and to procure M<sup>r</sup>.
      Alden's release. I shall recite a letter or 2. which will show the

        Good S<sup>r</sup>:

      <p>
        I have received your lr&#275;<sup>s</sup> by Captaine Standish, &amp; am
        unfainedly glad of Gods mercie towards you in y<sup>e</sup> recovery of
        your health, or some way thertoo. For y<sup>e</sup> bussines you write
        of, I thought meete to answer a word or 2. to your selfe, leaving the
        answer of your Gov<sup>or</sup> lre to our courte, to whom y<sup>e</sup>
        same, together with my selfe is directed. I conceive (till I hear new
        matter to y<sup>e</sup> contrary) that your patente may warrente your
        resistance of any English from trading at Kenebeck, and y<sup>t</sup>
        blood of Hocking, and y<sup>e</sup> partie he slue, will be required at
        his hands. Yet doe I with your selfe &amp; others sorrow for their
        deaths. I thinke likewise y<sup>t</sup> your generall lr&#275;s will
        satisfie our courte, and make them cease from any further inter medling
        in y<sup>e</sup> mater. I have upon y<sup>e</sup> same lre sett M<sup>r</sup>.
        Alden at liberty, and his sureties, and yet, least I should seeme to
        neglecte y<sup>e</sup> opinion of our court <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>&amp; y<sup>e</sup>
        frequente speeches of others with us, I have bound Captaine Standish to
        appeare y<sup>e</sup> 3. of June at our nexte courte, to make affidavid
        for y<sup>e</sup> coppie of y<sup>e</sup> patente, and to manifest the
        circumstances of Hockins provocations; both which will tend to y<sup>e</sup>
        clearing of your inocencie. If any unkindnes hath ben taken from what we
        have done, let it be further &amp; better considred of, I pray you; and
        I hope y<sup>e</sup> more you thinke of it, the lesse blame you will
        impute to us. At least you ought to be just in differencing them, whose
        opinions concurr [201] with your owne, from others who were opposites;
        and yet I may truly say, I have spoken w<sup>th</sup> no man in y<sup>e</sup>
        bussines who taxed you most, but they are such as have many wayes
        heretofore declared ther good affections towards your plantation. I
        further referr my selfe to y<sup>e</sup> reporte of Captaine Standish
        &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Allden; leaving you for this presente to Gods
        blessing, wishing unto you perfecte recovery of health, and y<sup>e</sup>
        long continuance of it. I desire to be lovingly remembred to M<sup>r</sup>.

        reconciled differences in y<sup>e</sup> best season &amp; maner I could;
        but Captaine Standish requiring an answer therof publickly in y<sup>e</sup>
        courte, I was forced to produce it, and that made y<sup>e</sup> breach
        soe wide as he can tell you. I propounded to y<sup>e</sup> courte, to

        presente will be very difficulte, but time cooleth distempers, and a

        againe. I pray you therfore, S<sup>r</sup>. set your wisdom &amp;
        patience a worke, and exhorte others to y<sup>e</sup> same, that things
        may not proceede from bad to worse, so making our contentions like y<sup>e</sup>

      By these things it appars what troubls rise herupon, and how hard they
      were to be reconciled; for though they hear were hartily sorrie for what
      was fallen out, yet they conceived they were unjustly injuried, and
      provoked to what was done; and that their neigbours (haveing no
      jurisdiction over them) did more then was mete, thus to imprison one of
      theirs, and bind them to [202] their courte. But yet being assured of
      their Christian love, and perswaded what was done was out of godly zeale,
      that religion might not suffer, nor sinne any way covered or borne with,
      espetially y<sup>e</sup> guilte of blood, of which all should be very
      consciencious in any whom soever, they did indeavore to appease &amp;
      satisfie them y<sup>e</sup> best they could; first, by informing them y<sup>e</sup>
      truth in all circomstances aboute y<sup>e</sup> matter; 2<sup>ly</sup>, in
      being willing to referr y<sup>e</sup> case to any indifferante and equall
      hearing and judgmente of the thing hear, and to answere it els wher when
      they should be duly called therunto; and further they craved M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winthrops, &amp; other of y<sup>e</sup> reve<sup>d</sup> magistrats ther,
      their advice &amp; direction herein. This did mollifie their minds, and
      bring things to a good &amp; comfortable issue in y<sup>e</sup> end.
    </p>
    <p>
      For they had this advice given them by M<sup>r</sup>. Winthrop, &amp;
      others concurring with him, that from their courte, they should write to
      the neigboure plantations, &amp; espetially that of y<sup>e</sup> lords,
      at Pascataway, and theirs of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, to appointe some
      to give <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>them
      meeting at some fitt place, to consulte &amp; determine in this matter, so
      as y<sup>e</sup> parties meeting might have full power to order &amp;
      bind, &amp;c. And that nothing be done to y<sup>e</sup> infringing or
      prejudice of y<sup>e</sup> liberties of any place. And for y<sup>e</sup>
      clearing of conscience, y<sup>e</sup> law of God is, y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup>
      preist lips must be consulted with, and therfore it was desired that y<sup>e</sup>
      ministers of every plantation might be presente to give their advice in
      pointe of conscience. Though this course seemed dangerous to some, yet
      they were so well assured of y<sup>e</sup> justice of their cause, and y<sup>e</sup>
      equitie of their freinds, as they put them selves upon it, &amp; appointed
      a time, of which they gave notice to y<sup>e</sup> severall places a month
      before hand; viz. Massachusets, Salem, &amp; Pascataway, or any other y<sup>t</sup>
      they would give notice too, and disired them to produce any evidence they
      could in y<sup>e</sup> case. The place for meeting was at Boston. But when
      y<sup>e</sup> day &amp; time came, none apered, but some of y<sup>e</sup>
      magistrats and ministers of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, and their owne.
      Seeing none of Passcataway or other places came, (haveing been thus
      desired, &amp; conveniente time given them for y<sup>t</sup> end,) M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winthrop &amp; y<sup>e</sup> rest said they could doe no more then they
      had done thus to requeste them, y<sup>e</sup> blame must rest on them. So
      they fell into a fair debating of things them selves; and after all things
      had been fully opened &amp; discussed, and y<sup>e</sup> opinione of each
      one demanded, both magistrats, and ministers, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>though they all could have
      wished these things had never been, yet they could not but lay y<sup>e</sup>
      blame &amp; guilt on Hockins owne head; and withall gave them such grave
      &amp; godly exhortations and advice, as they thought meete, both for y<sup>e</sup>
      presente &amp; future; which they allso imbraced with love &amp;
      thankfullnes, promising to indeavor to follow y<sup>e</sup> same. And thus
      was this matter ended, and ther love and concord renewed; and also M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winthrop &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Dudley write in their behalfes to y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord Ssay &amp; other gentl-men that were interesed in y<sup>t</sup>
      plantation, very effectually, w<sup>th</sup> which, togeather with their
      owne leters, and M<sup>r</sup>. Winslows furder declaration of things unto
      them, they rested well satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      [203] M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow was sente by them this year into England,
      partly to informe and satisfie y<sup>e</sup> Lord Say &amp; others, in y<sup>e</sup>
      former matter, as also to make answer and their just defence for y<sup>e</sup>
      same, if any thing should by any be prosecuted against them at
      Counsell-table, or els wher; but this matter tooke end, without any
      further trouble, as is before noted. And partly to signifie unto y<sup>e</sup>
      partners in England, that the terme of their trade with y<sup>e</sup>
      company here was out, and therfore he was sente to finishe y<sup>e</sup>
      accounts with them, and to bring them notice how much debtore they should
      remaine on y<sup>t</sup> accounte, and that they might know what further
      course would be best to hold. But y<sup>e</sup> issue of these things will
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>appear
      in y<sup>e</sup> next years passages. They now sente over by him a great
      returne, which was very acceptable unto them; which was in beaver 3738<sup>li</sup>.
      waight, (a great part of it, being coat-beaver, sould at 20<sup>s</sup>. p<sup>r</sup>
      pound,) and 234. otter skines;<a name="FNanchor_DL_116"
      id="FNanchor_DL_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_DL_116" class="fnanchor">[DL]</a>
      which alltogeather rise to a great sume of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year (in y<sup>e</sup> foreparte of y<sup>e</sup> same) they sente
      forth a barke to trad at y<sup>e</sup> Dutch-Plantation; and they mette
      ther with on Captaine Stone, that had lived in Christophers, one of y<sup>e</sup>
      West-Ende Ilands, and now had been some time in Virginia, and came from
      thence into these parts. He kept company with y<sup>e</sup> Dutch Gove<sup>r</sup>,
      and, I know not in what drunken fitt, he gott leave of y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
      to ceaise on their barke, when they were ready to come away, and had done
      their markett, haveing y<sup>e</sup> valew of 500<sup>li</sup>. worth of
      goods abord her; having no occasion at all, or any collour of ground for
      such a thing, but having made y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> drunck, so as
      he could scarce speake a right word; and when he urged him hear aboute, he
      answered him, <i>Als 't u beleeft</i>.<a name="FNanchor_DM_117"
      id="FNanchor_DM_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_DM_117" class="fnanchor">[DM]</a>
      So he gat abord, (the cheefe of their men &amp; marchant being ashore,)
      and with some of his owne men, made y<sup>e</sup> rest of theirs waigh
      anchor, sett sayle, &amp; carry her away towards Virginia. But diverse of
      y<sup>e</sup> Dutch sea-men, which had bene often at Plimoth, and kindly
      entertayned ther, said one to another, Shall we suffer our freinds to be
      thus abused, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>and
      have their goods carried away, before our faces, whilst our Gov<sup>r</sup>
      is drunke? They vowed they would never suffer it; and so gott a vessell or
      2. and pursued him, &amp; brought him in againe, and delivered them their
      barke &amp; goods againe.
    </p>
    <p>
      After wards Stone came into y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, and they sent
      &amp; commensed suite against him for this facte; but by mediation of
      freinds it was taken up, and y<sup>e</sup> suite lett fall. And in y<sup>e</sup>
      company of some other gentle-men Stone came afterwards to Plimoth, and had
      freindly &amp; civill entertainmente amongst them, with y<sup>e</sup>
      rest; but revenge boyled within his brest, (though concelled,) for some
      conceived he had a purpose (at one time) to have staped the Gov<sup>r</sup>,
      and put his hand to his dagger for that end, but by Gods providence and y<sup>e</sup>
      vigilance of some was prevented. He afterward returned to Virginia, in a
      pinass, with one Captaine Norton &amp; some others; and, I know not for
      what occasion, they would needs goe up Coonigtecutt River; and how they
      carried themselves I know not, but y<sup>e</sup> Indeans knoct him in y<sup>e</sup>
      head, as he lay in his cabine, and had thrown y<sup>e</sup> covering over
      his face (whether out of fear or desperation is uncertaine); this was his
      end. They likewise killed all y<sup>e</sup> rest, but Captaine Norton
      defended him selfe a long time against them all in y<sup>e</sup>
      cooke-roome, till by accidente the gunpowder tooke fire, which (for
      readynes) he had sett in an open thing before him, which did <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>so burne,
      &amp; scald him, &amp; blind his eyes, as he could make no longer
      resistance, but was slaine also by them, though they much comended his
      vallour. And having killed y<sup>e</sup> men, they made a pray of what
      they had, and chafered away some of their things to y<sup>e</sup> Dutch
      that lived their. But it was not longe before a quarell fell betweene the
      Dutch &amp; them, and they would have cutt of their bark; but they slue y<sup>e</sup>
      cheef sachem w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> shott of a murderer.<a

    <p>
      I am now to relate some strang and remarkable passages. Ther was a company
      of people lived in y<sup>e</sup> country, up above in y<sup>e</sup> river
      of Conigtecut, a great way from their trading house ther, and were enimise
      to those Indeans which lived aboute them, and of whom they stood in some
      fear (bing a stout people). About a thousand of them had inclosed them
      selves in a forte, which they had strongly palissadoed about. 3. or 4.
      Dutch men went up in y<sup>e</sup> begining of winter to live with them,
      to gett their trade, and prevente them for bringing it to y<sup>e</sup>
      English, or to fall into amitie with them; but at spring to bring all
      downe to their place. But their enterprise failed, for it pleased God to
      visite these Indeans with a great sicknes, and such a mortalitie that of a
      1000. above 900. and a halfe of them dyed, and many of them did rott above
      ground for want of buriall, and y<sup>e</sup> Dutch men <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>allmost
      starved before they could gett away, for ise and snow. But about Feb: they
      got with much difficultie to their trading house; whom they kindly
      releeved, being allmost spente with hunger and could. Being thus refreshed
      by them diverce days, they got to their owne place, and y<sup>e</sup>
      Dutch were very thankfull for this kindnes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This spring, also, those Indeans that lived aboute their trading house
      there fell sick of y<sup>e</sup> small poxe, and dyed most miserably; for
      a sorer disease cannot befall them; they fear it more then y<sup>e</sup>
      plague; for usualy they that have this disease have them in abundance, and
      for wante of bedding &amp; lin&#773;ing and other helps, they fall into a
      lamentable condition, as they lye on their hard matts, y<sup>e</sup> poxe
      breaking and mattering, and runing one into another, their skin cleaving
      (by reason therof) to the matts they lye on; when they turne them, a whole
      side will flea of at once, [204] (as it were,) and they will be all of a
      gore blood, most fearfull to behold; and then being very sore, what with
      could and other distempers, they dye like rotten sheep. The condition of
      this people was so lamentable, and they fell downe so generally of this
      diseas, as they were (in y<sup>e</sup> end) not able to help on another;
      no, not to make a fire, nor to fetch a litle water to drinke, nor any to
      burie y<sup>e</sup> dead; but would strivie as long as they could, and
      when they could procure no other means to make fire, they <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>would
      burne y<sup>e</sup> woden trayes &amp; dishes they ate their meate in, and
      their very bowes &amp; arrowes; &amp; some would crawle out on all foure
      to gett a litle water, and some times dye by y<sup>e</sup> way, &amp; not
      be able to gett in againe. But those of y<sup>e</sup> English house,
      (though at first they were afraid of y<sup>e</sup> infection,) yet seeing
      their woefull and sadd condition, and hearing their pitifull cries and
      lamentations, they had compastion of them, and dayly fetched them wood
      &amp; water, and made them fires, gott them victualls whilst they lived,
      and buried them when they dyed. For very few of them escaped,
      notwithstanding they did what they could for them, to y<sup>e</sup>
      haszard of them selvs. The cheefe Sachem him selfe now dyed, &amp; allmost
      all his freinds &amp; kinred. But by y<sup>e</sup> marvelous goodnes &amp;
      providens of God not one of y<sup>e</sup> English was so much as sicke, or
      in y<sup>e</sup> least measure tainted with this disease, though they
      dayly did these offices for them for many weeks togeather. And this mercie
      which they shewed them was kindly taken, and thankfully acknowledged of
      all y<sup>e</sup> Indeans that knew or heard of y<sup>e</sup> same; and
      their m<sup>rs</sup> here did much comend &amp; reward them for y<sup>e</sup>
      same.

      M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow was very wellcome to them in England, and y<sup>e</sup>
      more in regard of y<sup>e</sup> large returne he brought with him, which
      came all safe to their hands, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390"
      id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>and was well sould. And he was borne in
      hand, (at least he so apprehended,) that all accounts should be cleared
      before his returne, and all former differences ther aboute well setled.
      And so he writ over to them hear, that he hoped to cleare y<sup>e</sup>
      accounts, and bring them over with him; and y<sup>t</sup> the accounte of
      y<sup>e</sup> White Angele would be taken of, and all things fairly ended.
      But it came to pass [205] that, being occasioned to answer some complaints
      made against the countrie at Counsell bord, more cheefly concerning their
      neigbours in y<sup>e</sup> Bay then them selves hear, the which he did to
      good effecte, and further prosecuting such things as might tend to y<sup>e</sup>
      good of y<sup>e</sup> whole, as well them selves as others, aboute y<sup>e</sup>
      wrongs and incroachments that the French &amp; other strangers both had
      and were like further to doe unto them, if not prevented, he prefered this
      petition following to their Hon<sup>rs</sup> that were deputed

      This petition found good acceptation with most of them, and Mr. Winslow
      was heard sundry times by them, and appointed further to attend for an
      answer from their Lo<sup>pps</sup>, espetially, having upon conferance
      with them laid downe a way how this might be doone without any either
      charge or trouble to y<sup>e</sup> state; only by furnishing some of y<sup>e</sup>
      cheefe of y<sup>e</sup> cuntry hear with authoritie, who would undertake
      it at their owne charge, and in such a way as should be without any
      publick disturbance. But this crossed both S<sup>r</sup> Ferdinandos
      Gorges' &amp; Cap: Masons designe, and y<sup>e</sup> arch-bishop of
      Counterberies by them; for S<sup>r</sup> Ferd: Gorges (by y<sup>e</sup>
      arch-pps favore) was to have been sent over generall Gov<sup>r</sup> into
      y<sup>e</sup> countrie, and to have had means from y<sup>e</sup> state for
      y<sup>t</sup> end, and was now upon dispatch and conclude of y<sup>e</sup>
      bussines. And y<sup>e</sup> arch-bishops <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>purposs &amp; intente was,
      by his means, &amp; some he should send with him, (to be furnished with
      Episcopall power,) [206] to disturbe y<sup>e</sup> peace of y<sup>e</sup>
      churches here, and to overthrow their proceedings and further growth,
      which was y<sup>e</sup> thing he aimed at. But it so fell out (by Gods
      providence) that though he in y<sup>e</sup> end crost this petition from
      taking any further effecte in this kind, yet by this as a cheefe means the
      plotte and whole bussines of his &amp; S<sup>r</sup> Ferdinandos fell to y<sup>e</sup>
      ground, and came to nothing. When M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow should have had
      his suit granted, (as indeed upon y<sup>e</sup> pointe it was,) and should
      have been confirmed, the arch-bishop put a stop upon it, and M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winslow, thinking to gett it freed, went to y<sup>e</sup> bord againe; but
      y<sup>e</sup> bishop, S<sup>r</sup> Ferd: and Captine Masson, had, as it
      seemes, procured Morton (of whom mention is made before, &amp; his base
      carriage) to complaine; to whose complaints M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow made
      answer to y<sup>e</sup> good satisfaction of y<sup>e</sup> borde, who
      checked Morton and rebuked him sharply, &amp; allso blamed S<sup>r</sup>
      Fer<sup>d</sup> Gorges, &amp; Masson, for countenancing him. But y<sup>e</sup>
      bish: had a further end &amp; use of his presence, for he now begane to
      question M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow of many things; as of teaching in y<sup>e</sup>
      church publickly, of which Morton accused him, and gave evidence that he
      had seen and heard him doe it; to which M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow answered,
      that some time (wanting a minster) he did exercise his gifte to help y<sup>e</sup>
      edification of his breethren, when <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393"
      id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>they wanted better means, w<sup>ch</sup> was
      not often. Then aboute mariage, the which he also confessed, that, haveing
      been called to place of magistracie, he had sometimes maried some. And
      further tould their lord<sup>ps</sup> y<sup>t</sup> mariage was a civille
      thinge, &amp; he found no wher in y<sup>e</sup> word of God y<sup>t</sup>
      it was tyed to ministrie. Again, they were necessitated so to doe, having
      for a long time togeather at first no minister; besids, it was no
      new-thing, for he had been so maried him selfe in Holand, by y<sup>e</sup>
      magistrats in their Statt-house. But in y<sup>e</sup> end (to be short),
      for these things, y<sup>e</sup> bishop, by vemente importunity, gott y<sup>e</sup>
      bord at last to consente to his comittemente; so he was comited to y<sup>e</sup>
      Fleete, and lay ther 17. weeks, or ther aboute, before he could gett to be
      released. And this was y<sup>e</sup> end of this petition, and this
      bussines; only y<sup>e</sup> others designe was also frustrated hereby,
      with other things concurring, which was no smalle blessing to y<sup>e</sup>
      people here.
    </p>
    <p>
      But y<sup>e</sup> charge fell heavie on them hear, not only in M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winslows expences, (which could not be smale,) but by y<sup>e</sup>
      hinderance of their bussines both ther and hear, by his personall
      imploymente. For though this was as much or more for others then for them
      hear, and by them cheefly he was put on this bussines, (for the plantation
      k&#275;we nothing of it till they heard of his imprisonmente,) yet y<sup>e</sup>
      whole charge lay on them.

      Now for their owne bussines; whatsoever M<sup>r</sup>. Sherleys mind was
      before, (or M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow apprehension of y<sup>e</sup> same,) he
      now declared him selfe plainly, that he would neither take of y<sup>e</sup>
      White-Angell from y<sup>e</sup> accounte, nor [207] give any further
      accounte, till he had received more into his hands; only a prety good
      supply of goods were sent over, but of y<sup>e</sup> most, no note of
      their prises, or so orderly an invoyce as formerly; which M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winslow said he could not help, because of his restrainte. Only now M<sup>r</sup>.
      Sherley &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews sent
      over a letter of atturney under their hands &amp; seals, to recovere what
      they could of M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton for y<sup>e</sup> Angells accounte;
      but sent them neither y<sup>e</sup> bonds, nor covenants, or such other
      evidence or accounts, as they had aboute these matters. I shall here
      inserte a few passages out of M<sup>r</sup>. Sherleys letters aboute these
      things.

      This year they sustained an other great loss from y<sup>e</sup> French.
      Monsier de Aulnay coming into y<sup>e</sup> harbore of Penobscote, and
      having before gott some of y<sup>e</sup> cheefe y<sup>t</sup> belonged to
      y<sup>e</sup> house abord his vessell, by sutlty coming upon them in their
      shalop, he gott them to pilote him in; and after getting y<sup>e</sup>
      rest into his power, he tooke possession of y<sup>e</sup> house in y<sup>e</sup>
      name of y<sup>e</sup> king of France; and partly by threatening, &amp;
      other wise, made Mr. Willett (their agente ther) to approve of <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup>
      sale of y<sup>e</sup> goods their unto him, of which he sett y<sup>e</sup>
      price him selfe [208] in effecte, and made an inventory therof, (yett
      leaving out sundry things,) but made no paymente for them; but tould them
      in convenient time he would doe it if they came for it. For y<sup>e</sup>
      house &amp; fortification, &amp;c. he would not alow, nor accounte any
      thing, saing that they which build on another mans ground doe forfite y<sup>e</sup>
      same. So thus turning them out of all, (with a great deale of complemente,
      and many fine words,) he let them have their shalop and some victualls to
      bring them home. Coming home and relating all the passages, they here were
      much troubled at it, &amp; haveing had this house robbed by y<sup>e</sup>
      French once before, and lost then above 500<sup>li</sup>. (as is before
      remembred), and now to loose house &amp; all, did much move them. So as
      they resolved to consulte with their freinds in y<sup>e</sup> Bay, and if
      y<sup>ey</sup> approved of it, (ther being now many ships ther,) they
      intended to hire a ship of force, and seeke to beat out y<sup>e</sup>
      Frenche, and recover it againe. Ther course was well approved on, if them
      selves could bear y<sup>e</sup> charge; so they hired a fair ship of above
      300. tune, well fitted with ordnance, and agreed with y<sup>e</sup> m<sup>r</sup>.
      (one Girling) to this effect: that he and his company should deliver them
      y<sup>e</sup> house, (after they had driven out, or surprised y<sup>e</sup>
      French,) and give them peacable possession therof, and of all such trading
      comodities as should ther be found; and give y<sup>e</sup> <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>French
      fair quarter &amp; usage, if they would yeeld. In consideration wherof he
      was to have 700<sup>li</sup>. of beaver, to be delivered him ther, when he
      had done y<sup>e</sup> thing; but if he did not accomplish it, he was to
      loose his labour, and have nothing. With him they also sent their owne
      bark, and about 20. men, with Captaine Standish, to aide him (if neede
      weer), and to order things, if the house was regained; and then to pay him
      y<sup>e</sup> beaver, which they keept abord their owne barke. So they
      with their bark piloted him thither, and brought him safe into y<sup>e</sup>
      harbor. But he was so rash &amp; heady as he would take no advice, nor
      would suffer Captaine Standish to have time to summone them, (who had com&#773;ission
      &amp; order so to doe,) neither would doe it him selfe; the which, it was
      like, if it had been done, &amp; they come to affaire parley, seeing their
      force, they would have yeelded. Neither would he have patience to bring
      his ship wher she might doe execution, but begane to shoot at distance
      like a madd man, and did them no hurte at all; the which when those of y<sup>e</sup>
      plantation saw, they were much greeved, and went to him &amp; tould him he
      would doe no good if he did not lay his ship beter to pass (for she might
      lye within pistoll shott of y<sup>e</sup> house). At last, when he saw his
      owne folly, he was perswaded, and layed her well, and bestowed a few shott
      to good purposs. But now, when he was in a way to doe some good, his
      powder was goone; for though he had <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>...<a name="FNanchor_DO_119"
      id="FNanchor_DO_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_DO_119" class="fnanchor">[DO]</a>
      peece of ordnance, it did now [209] appeare he had but a barrell of
      powder, and a peece; so he could doe no good, but was faine to draw of
      againe; by which means y<sup>e</sup> enterprise was made frustrate, and y<sup>e</sup>
      French incouraged; for all y<sup>e</sup> while that he shot so
      unadvisedly, they lay close under a worke of earth, &amp; let him consume
      him selfe. He advised with y<sup>e</sup> Captaine how he might be supplyed
      with powder, for he had not to carie him home; so he tould him he would
      goe to y<sup>e</sup> next plantation, and doe his indeour to procure him
      some, and so did; but understanding, by intelligence, that he intended to
      ceiase on y<sup>e</sup> barke, &amp; surprise y<sup>e</sup> beaver, he
      sent him the powder, and brought y<sup>e</sup> barke &amp; beaver home.
      But Girling never assualted y<sup>e</sup> place more, (seeing him selfe
      disapoyented,) but went his way; and this was y<sup>e</sup> end of this
      bussines.

      This year, y<sup>e</sup> 14. or 15. of August (being Saturday) was such a
      mighty storme of wind &amp; raine, as none living in these parts, either
      English or Indeans, ever saw. Being like (for y<sup>e</sup> time it
      continued) to those Hauricanes and Tuffons that writers make mention of in
      y<sup>e</sup> Indeas. It began in y<sup>e</sup> morning, a litle before
      day, and grue not by degrees, but came with violence in y<sup>e</sup>
      begining, to y<sup>e</sup> great amasmente of many. It blew downe sundry
      [211] houses, &amp; uncovered others; diverce vessells were lost at sea,
      and many more in extreme danger. It caused y<sup>e</sup> sea to swell (to
      y<sup>e</sup> southward <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402"
      id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>of this place) above 20. foote, right up
      &amp; downe, and made many of the Indeans to clime into trees for their
      saftie; it tooke of y<sup>e</sup> borded roofe of a house which belonged
      to the plantation at Manamet, and floted it to another place, the posts
      still standing in y<sup>e</sup> ground; and if it had continued long
      without y<sup>e</sup> shifting of y<sup>e</sup> wind, it is like it would
      have drouned some parte of y<sup>e</sup> cuntrie. It blew downe many
      hundered thowsands of trees, turning up the stronger by the roots, and
      breaking the hiegher pine trees of in the midle, and y<sup>e</sup> tall
      yonge oaks &amp; walnut trees of good biggnes were wound like a withe,
      very strang &amp; fearfull to behould. It begane in y<sup>e</sup>
      southeast, and parted toward y<sup>e</sup> south &amp; east, and vered
      sundry ways; but y<sup>e</sup> greatest force of it here was from y<sup>e</sup>
      former quarters. It continued not (in y<sup>e</sup> extremitie) above 5.
      or 6. houers, but y<sup>e</sup> violence begane to abate. The signes and
      marks of it will remaine this 100. years in these parts wher it was

      Some of their neighbours in y<sup>e</sup> Bay, hereing of y<sup>e</sup>
      fame of Conightecute River, had a hankering mind after it, (as was before
      noted,) and now understanding that y<sup>e</sup> Indeans were swepte away
      with y<sup>e</sup> late great mortalitie, the fear of whom was an obstacle
      unto them before, which being now taken away, they begane now to prosecute
      it with great egernes. The greatest differances fell betweene those of
      Dorchester <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>plantation
      and them hear; for they set their minde on that place, which they had not
      only purchased of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, but wher they had builte;
      intending only (if they could not remove them) that they should have but a
      smale moyety left to y<sup>e</sup> house, as to a single family; whose
      doings and proceedings were conceived to be very injurious, to attempte
      not only to intrude them selves into y<sup>e</sup> rights &amp;
      possessions of others, but in effect to thrust them out of all. Many were
      y<sup>e</sup> leters &amp; passages that went betweene them hear aboute,
      which would be to long here to relate.

        this river will not afford, excepte it be at this place which we have,
        namly, to be a great towne, and have comodious dwellings for many

        of y<sup>e</sup> Dutch &amp; Indeans, and bought y<sup>e</sup> land, (to

        chargable possession, and kept y<sup>e</sup> Dutch from further

        charge; for y<sup>e</sup> first company had well nie starved had it not

        did not once speak therof, &amp;c. Also I gave their goods house roome

      Ans: Their answer was to this effecte. That if it was y<sup>e</sup> Lords
      wast, it was them selves that found it so, &amp; not they; and have since
      bought it of y<sup>e</sup> right <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406"
      id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>oweners, and maintained a chargable
      possession upon it al this while, as them selves could not but know. And
      because of present ingagments and other hinderances which lay at presente
      upon them, must it therfore be lawfull for them to goe and take it from
      them? It was well known that they are upon a barren place, wher they were
      by necessitie cast; and neither they nor theirs could longe continue upon
      y<sup>e</sup> same; and why should they (because they were more ready,
      &amp; more able at presente) goe and deprive them of that which they had w<sup>th</sup>
      charg &amp; hazard provided, &amp; intended to remove to, as soone as they
      could &amp; were able?
    </p>
    <p>
      They had another passage in their letter; they had rather have to doe with
      the lords in England, to whom (as they heard it reported) some of them
      should say that they had rather give up their right to them, (if they must
      part with it,) then to y<sup>e</sup> church of Dorchester, &amp;c. And
      that they should be less fearfull to offend y<sup>e</sup> lords, then they
      were them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Answer: Their answer was, that what soever they had heard, (more then was
      true,) yet y<sup>e</sup> case was not so with them that they had need to
      give away their rights &amp; adventurs, either to y<sup>e</sup> lords, or
      them; yet, if they might measure their fear of offence by their practise,
      they had rather (in that poynte) they should deal with y<sup>e</sup>
      lords, who were beter able to bear it, or help them selves, then they
      were.

      But least I should be teadious, I will forbear other things, and come to
      the conclusion that was made in y<sup>e</sup> endd. To make any forcible
      resistance was farr from their thoughts, (they had enough of y<sup>t</sup>
      about Kenebeck,) and to live in continuall contention with their freinds
      &amp; brethren would be uncomfortable, and too heavie a burden to bear.
      Therfore for peace sake (though they conceived they suffered much in this
      thing) they thought it better to let them have it upon as good termes as
      they could gett; and so they fell to treaty. The first thing y<sup>t</sup>
      (because they had made so many &amp; long disputs aboute it) they would
      have them to grante was, y<sup>t</sup> they had right too it, or ells they
      would never treat aboute it. The<a name="FNanchor_DP_120"
      id="FNanchor_DP_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_DP_120" class="fnanchor">[DP]</a>
      which being acknowledged, &amp; yeelded unto by them, this was y<sup>e</sup>
      conclusion they came unto in y<sup>e</sup> end after much adoe: that they
      should retaine their house, and have the 16. parte of all they had bought
      of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans; and y<sup>e</sup> other should have all y<sup>e</sup>
      rest of y<sup>e</sup> land; leaveing such a moyety to those [214] of
      New-towne, as they reserved for them. This 16. part was to be taken in too
      places; one towards y<sup>e</sup> house, the other towards New-townes
      proporrtion. Also they were to pay according to proportion, what had been
      disbursed to y<sup>e</sup> Indeans for y<sup>e</sup> purchass. Thus was y<sup>e</sup>
      controversie ended, but the unkindnes not so soone forgotten. They of
      New-towne delt more fairly, desireing only what they could <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>conveniently
      spare, from a competancie reserved for a plantation, for them selves;
      which made them the more carfull to procure a moyety for them, in this
      agreement &amp; distribution.

      Amongst y<sup>e</sup> other bussinesses that M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow had to
      doe in England, he had order from y<sup>e</sup> church to provid &amp;
      bring over some able &amp; fitt man for to be their minister. And
      accordingly he had procured a godly and a worthy<a name="FNanchor_DQ_121"
      id="FNanchor_DQ_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_DQ_121" class="fnanchor">[DQ]</a>
      man, one M<sup>r</sup>. Glover; but it pleased God when he was prepared
      for the viage, he fell sick of a feaver and dyed. Afterwards, when he was
      ready to come away, he became acquainted with M<sup>r</sup>. Norton, who
      was willing to come over, but would not ingage him selfe to this place,
      otherwise then he should see occasion when he came hear; and if he liked
      better else wher, to repay y<sup>e</sup> charge laid out for him, (which
      came to aboute 70<sup>li</sup>.) and to be at his liberty. He stayed
      aboute a year with them, after he came over, and was well liked of them,
      &amp; much desired by them; but he was invited to Ipswich, wher were many
      rich &amp; able men, and sundry of his aquaintance; so he wente to them,
      &amp; is their minister. Aboute half of y<sup>e</sup> charg was repayed, y<sup>e</sup>

    <p>
      In y<sup>e</sup> former year, because they perceived by M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winslows later letters that no accounts would be sente, they resolved to
      keep y<sup>e</sup> beaver, and send no more, till they had them, or came
      to some further agreemente. At least they would forbear till M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winslow came over, that by more full conferance with him they might better
      understand what was meete to be done. But when he came, though he brought
      no accounts, yet he perswaded them to send y<sup>e</sup> beaver, &amp; was
      confident upon y<sup>e</sup> receite of y<sup>t</sup> beaver, &amp; his
      letters, they should have accounts y<sup>e</sup> nexte year; and though
      they thought his grounds but weake, that gave him this hope, &amp; made
      him so confidente, yet by his importunitie they yeelded, &amp; sente y<sup>e</sup>
      same, ther being a ship at y<sup>e</sup> latter end of year, by whom they
      sente 1150<sup>li</sup>. waight of beaver, and 200. otter skins, besids
      sundrie small furrs, as 55. minks, 2. black foxe skins, &amp;c. And this
      year, in the spring, came in a Dutch man, who thought to have traded at y<sup>e</sup>
      Dutch-forte; [215] but they would not suffer him. He, having good store of
      trading goods, came to this place, &amp; tendred them to sell; of whom
      they bought a good quantitie, they being very good &amp; fitte for their
      turne, as Dutch roll, ketles, &amp;c., which goods amounted to y<sup>e</sup>
      valew of 500<sup>li</sup>., for y<sup>e</sup> paymente of which they
      passed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>bills
      to M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley in England, having before sente y<sup>e</sup>
      forementioned parcell of beaver. And now this year (by another ship) sente
      an other good round parcell that might come to his hands, &amp; be sould
      before any of these bills should be due. The quantity of beaver now sent
      was 1809<sup>li</sup>. waight, and of otters 10. skins, and shortly after
      (y<sup>e</sup> same year) was sent by another ship (Mr. Langrume maister),
      in beaver 0719<sup>li</sup>. waight, and of otter skins 199. concerning
      which M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley thus writs.

        Your leters I have received, with 8. hoggsheads of beaver by Ed:
        Wilkinson, master of y<sup>e</sup> Falcon. Blessed be God for y<sup>e</sup>
        safe coming of it. I have also seen &amp; acceped 3. bills of exchainge,
        &amp;c. But I must now acquainte you how the Lords heavie hand is upon
        this kingdom in many places, but cheefly in this cittie, with his
        judgmente of y<sup>e</sup> plague. The last weeks bill was 1200. &amp;
        odd, I fear this will be more; and it is much feared it will be a winter
        sicknes. By reason wherof it is incredible y<sup>e</sup> number of
        people y<sup>t</sup> are gone into y<sup>e</sup> cuntry &amp; left y<sup>e</sup>
        citie. I am perswaded many more then went out y<sup>e</sup> last
        sicknes; so as here is no trading, carriers from most places put downe;
        nor no receiving of any money, though long due. M<sup>r</sup>. Hall ows
        us more then would pay these bills, but he, his wife, and all, are in y<sup>e</sup>
        cuntrie, 60. miles from London. I write to him, he came up, but could
        not pay us. I am perswaded if I should offer to sell y<sup>e</sup>
        beaver at 8s. p<sup>r</sup> pound, it would not yeeld money; but when y<sup>e</sup>
        Lord shall please to cease his hand, I hope we shall have better &amp;
        quicker markets; so it shall lye by. Before I accepted y<sup>e</sup>
        bills, I acquainted M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews
        with them, &amp; how ther could be no money made nor <span

        and that it would be a great discredite to you, which never yet had any
        turned back, and a shame to us, haveing 1800<sup>li</sup>. of beaver
        lying by us, and more oweing then y<sup>e</sup> bills come too, &amp;c.
        But all was nothing; neither of them both will put too their finger to
        help. I offered to supply my 3. parte, but they gave me their answer
        they neither would nor could, &amp;c. How ever, your bils shall be
        satisfied to y<sup>e</sup> parties good contente; but I would not have
        thought they would have left either you or me at this time, &amp;c. You
        will and may expect I should write more, &amp; answer your leters, but I
        am not a day in y<sup>e</sup> weeke at home at towne, but carry my books
        &amp; all to Clapham; for here is y<sup>e</sup> miserablest time y<sup>t</sup>
        I thinke hath been known in many ages. I have know&#773; 3. great
        sickneses, but none like this. And that which should be a means to
        pacifie y<sup>e</sup> Lord, &amp; help us, that is taken away, preaching
        put downe in many places, not a sermone in Westminster on y<sup>e</sup>
        saboth, nor in many townes aboute us; y<sup>e</sup> Lord in mercie looke
        uppon us. In the begining of y<sup>e</sup> year was a great [216]
        drought, &amp; no raine for many weeks togeather, so as all was burnte
        up, haye, at 5<sup>li</sup>. a load; and now all raine, so as much
        sommer come &amp; later haye is spoyled. Thus y<sup>e</sup> Lord sends
        judgmente after judgmente, and yet we cannot see, nor humble our selves;
        and therfore may justly fear heavier judgments, unless we speedyly
        repente, &amp; returne unto him, which y<sup>e</sup> Lord give us grace
        to doe, if it be his blessed will. Thus desiring you to remember us in

      This was all the answer they had from M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley, by which M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winslow saw his hops failed him. So they now resoloved to send no more
      beaver in y<sup>t</sup> way <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412"
      id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>which they had done, till they came to some
      issue or other aboute these things. But now came over letters from M<sup>r</sup>.
      Andrews &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp full of complaints, that they
      marveled y<sup>t</sup> nothing was sent over, by which any of their moneys
      should be payed in; for it did appear by y<sup>e</sup> accounte sente in
      An<sup>o</sup> 1631. that they were each of them out, aboute a leven
      hundered pounds a peece, and all this while had not received one penie
      towards y<sup>e</sup> same. But now M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley sought to draw
      more money from them, and was offended because they deneyed him; and
      blamed them hear very much that all was sent to M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley,
      &amp; nothing to them. They marvelled much at this, for they conceived
      that much of their moneis had been paid in, &amp; y<sup>t</sup> yearly
      each of them had received a proportionable quantity out of y<sup>e</sup>
      larg returnes sent home. For they had sente home since y<sup>t</sup>
      accounte was received in An<sup>o</sup> 1631. (in which all &amp; more
      then all their debts, w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>t</sup> years supply, was
      charged upon them) these sumes following.

      All these sumes were safly rceived &amp; well sould, as appears by leters.
      The coat beaver usualy at 20<sup>s</sup>. p<sup>r</sup> pound, and some at
      24<sup>s</sup>.; the skin at 15. &amp; sometimes 16. I doe not remember
      any under 14. It may be y<sup>e</sup> last year might be something lower,
      so also ther were some small furrs that are not recconed in this accounte,
      &amp; some black beaver at higer rates, to make up y<sup>e</sup> defects.
      [217] It was conceived that y<sup>e</sup> former parcells of beaver came
      to litle less then 10000<sup>li</sup>. sterling, and y<sup>e</sup> otter
      skins would pay all y<sup>e</sup> charge, &amp; they w<sup>th</sup> other
      furrs make up besids if any thing wanted of y<sup>e</sup> former sume.
      When y<sup>e</sup> former accounte was passed, all their debts (those of
      White-Angelle &amp; Frendship included) came but to 4770<sup>li</sup>. And
      they could not estimate that all y<sup>e</sup> supplies since sent them,
      &amp; bills payed for them, could come to above 2000<sup>li</sup>. so as
      they conceived their debts had been payed, with advantage or intrest. But
      it may be objected, how comes it that they could not as well exactly sett
      downe their receits, as their returnes, but thus estimate it. I answer, 2.
      things were y<sup>e</sup> cause of it; the first &amp; principall was,
      that y<sup>e</sup> new accountante, which they in England would needs
      presse upon them, did wholy faile them, &amp; could never give them any
      accounte; but trusting to his memorie, &amp; lose papers, let things rune
      into such confusion, that neither he, nor any with him, could bring things
      to rights. But being often called upon to perfecte his <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>accounts,
      he desired to have such a time, and such a time of leasure, and he would
      doe it. In y<sup>e</sup> intrime he fell into a great sicknes, and in
      conclusion it fell out he could make no accounte at all. His books were
      after a litle good begining left altogeather unperfect; and his papers,
      some were lost, &amp; others so confused, as he knew not what to make of
      them him selfe, when they came to be searched &amp; examined. This was not
      unknowne to M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley; and they came to smarte for it to
      purposs, (though it was not their faulte,) both thus in England, and also
      here; for they conceived they lost some hundreds of pounds for goods
      trusted out in y<sup>e</sup> place, which were lost for want of clear
      accounts to call them in. Another reason of this mischeefe was, that after
      M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow was sente into England to demand accounts, and to
      excepte against y<sup>e</sup> Whit-Angell, they never had any price sent
      with their goods, nor any certaine invoyce of them; but all things stood
      in confusion, and they were faine to guesse at y<sup>e</sup> prises of
      them.

      They write back to M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp,
      and tould them they marveled they should write they had sent nothing home
      since y<sup>e</sup> last accounts; for they had sente a great deale; and
      it might rather be marveled how they could be able to send so much, besids
      defraying all charg at home, and what they had lost by the French, and so
      much cast away at sea, when M<sup>r</sup>. Peirce lost his ship on y<sup>e</sup>
      coast of Virginia. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>What
      they had sente was to them all, and to them selves as well as M<sup>r</sup>.
      Sherley, and if they did not looke after it, it was their owne falts; they
      must referr them to M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley, who had received [218] it, to
      demand it of him. They allso write to M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley to y<sup>e</sup>
      same purposs, and what the others complaints were.

      This year 2. shallops going to Coonigtecutt with goods from y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachusetts of such as removed theither to plante, were in an easterly
      storme cast away in coming into this harbore in y<sup>e</sup> night; the
      boats men were lost, and the goods were driven all alonge the shore, and
      strowed up &amp; downe at high-water marke. But y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
      caused them to be gathered up, and drawn togeather, and appointed some to
      take an inventory of them, and others to wash &amp; drie such things as
      had neede therof; by which means most of y<sup>e</sup> goods were saved,
      and restored to y<sup>e</sup> owners. Afterwards anotheir boate of theirs
      (going thither likwise) was cast away near unto Manoanscusett, and such
      goods as came a shore were preserved for them. Such crosses they mette
      with in their beginings; which some imputed as a correction from God for
      their intrution (to y<sup>e</sup> wrong of others) into y<sup>t</sup>
      place. But I dare not be bould with Gods judgments in this kind.

      In y<sup>e</sup> year 1634, the Pequents (a stoute and warlike people),

      termes of freindship with y<sup>e</sup> English of y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachusetts. Now y<sup>e</sup> Pequents, being conscious of y<sup>e</sup>
      guilte of Captain-Stones death, whom they knew to be an-English man, as
      also those y<sup>t</sup> were with him, and being fallen out with y<sup>e</sup>
      Dutch, least they should have over many enemies at once, sought to make
      freindship with y<sup>e</sup> English of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusetts; and
      for y<sup>t</sup> end sent both messengers &amp; gifts unto them, as
      appears by some letters sent from y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> hither.

      <p>
        Dear &amp; worthy S<sup>r</sup>: &amp;c. To let you know somwhat of our
        affairs, you may understand that y<sup>e</sup> Pequents have sent some
        of theirs to us, to desire our freindship, and offered much wampam &amp;
        beaver, &amp;c. The first messengers were dismissed without answer; with
        y<sup>e</sup> next we had diverce dayes conferance, and taking y<sup>e</sup>
        advice of some of our ministers, and seeking the Lord in it, we
        concluded a peace &amp; freindship with them, upon these conditions:
        that they should deliver up to us those men who were guilty of Stones
        death, &amp;c. And if we desired to plant in Conightecute, they should
        give up their right to us, and so we would send to trade with them as
        our freinds (which was y<sup>e</sup> cheefe thing we aimed at, being now
        in warr with y<sup>e</sup> Dutch and y<sup>e</sup> rest of their
        neigbours). To this they readily agreed; and that we should meadiate a
        peace betweene them and the Narigansetts; for which end they were
        contente we should give the Narigansets parte of y<sup>t</sup> presente,

        for Captein Stone, they tould us ther were but 2. left of those who had
        any hand in his death; and that they killed him in a just quarell, for

      After these things, and, as I take, this year, John Oldom, (of whom much
      is spoken before,) being now an inhabitant of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusetts,
      went w<sup>th</sup> a small vessell, &amp; slenderly mand, a trading into
      these south parts, and upon a quarell betweene him &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
      Indeans was cutt of by them (as hath been before noted) at an iland called
      by y<sup>e</sup> Indeans Munisses, but since by <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup> English Block
      Iland. This, with y<sup>e</sup> former about the death of Stone, and the
      baffoyling of y<sup>e</sup> Pequents with y<sup>e</sup> English of y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachusetts, moved them to set out some to take revenge, and require
      satisfaction for these wrongs; but it was done so superfitially, and
      without their acquainting of those of Conightecute &amp; other neighbours
      with y<sup>e</sup> same, as they did litle good. But their neigbours had
      more hurt done, for some of y<sup>e</sup> murderers of Oldome fled to y<sup>e</sup>
      Pequents, and though the English went to y<sup>e</sup> Pequents, and had
      some parley with them, yet they did but delude them, &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
      English returned without doing any thing to purpose, being frustrate of
      their oppertunitie by y<sup>e</sup> others deceite. After y<sup>e</sup>
      English were returned, the Pequents tooke their time and oppertunitie to
      cut of some of y<sup>e</sup> English as they passed in boats, and went on
      fouling, and assaulted them y<sup>e</sup> next spring at their
      habytations, as will appear in its place. I doe but touch these things,
      because I make no question they wall be more fully &amp; distinctly
      handled by them selves, who had more exacte knowledg of them, and whom

      In y<sup>e</sup> fore parte of this year, the Pequents fell openly upon y<sup>e</sup>
      English at Conightecute, in y<sup>e</sup> lower parts of y<sup>e</sup>
      river, and slew sundry of them, (as they were at work in y<sup>e</sup>
      feilds,) both men &amp; women, to y<sup>e</sup> great terrour of y<sup>e</sup>
      rest; and wente away in great prid &amp; triumph, with many high threats.
      They allso assalted a fort at y<sup>e</sup> rivers mouth, though strong
      and well defended; and though they did not their prevaile, yet it struk
      them with much fear &amp; astonishmente to see their bould attempts in the
      face of danger; which made them in all places to stand upon their gard,
      and to prepare for resistance, and ernestly to solissite their freinds and
      confederats in y<sup>e</sup> Bay of Massachusets to send them speedy aide,
      for they looked for more forcible assaults. M<sup>r</sup>. Vane, being
      then Gov<sup>r</sup>, write from their Generall Courte to them hear, to
      joyne with them in this warr; to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420"

      opportunitie to write to them aboute some former things, as well as
      presente, considerable hereaboute. The which will best appear in y<sup>e</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> answer which he returned to y<sup>e</sup> same, which I
      shall here inserte.
    </p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        S<sup>r</sup>: The Lord having so disposed, as that your letters to our
        late Gov<sup>r</sup> is fallen to my lott to make answer unto, I could
        have wished I might have been at more freedome of time &amp; thoughts
        also, that I might have done it more to your &amp; my owne satisfaction.
        But what shall be wanting now may be supplyed hereafter. For y<sup>e</sup>
        matters which from your selfe &amp; counsell were propounded &amp;
        objected to us, we thought not fitte to make them so publicke as y<sup>e</sup>
        cognizance of our Generall Courte. But as they have been considered by
        those of our counsell, this answer we thinke fitt to returne unto you.
        (1.) Wereas you signifie your willingnes to joyne with us in this warr
        against y<sup>e</sup> Pequents, though you cannot ingage your selves
        without y<sup>e</sup> consente of your Generall Courte, we acknowledg
        your good affection towards us, (which we never had cause to doubt of,)
        and are willing to attend your full resolution, when it may most
        seasonably be ripened. (2<sup>ly</sup>.) Wheras you make this warr to be
        our peopls, and not [221] to conceirne your selves, otherwise then by
        consequence, we do in parte consente to you therin; yet we suppose,
        that, in case of perill, you will not stand upon such terms, as we hope
        we should not doe towards you; and withall we conceive that you looke at
        y<sup>e</sup> Pequents, and all other Indeans, as a com&#773;one enimie,
        who, though he may take occasion of y<sup>e</sup> begining of his rage,
        from some one parte of y<sup>e</sup> English, yet if he prevaile, will
        surly pursue his advantage, to y<sup>e</sup> rooting out of y<sup>e</sup>
        whole nation. Therfore when we desired your help, we did it not without
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>respecte
        to your owne saftie, as ours. (3<sup>ly</sup>.) Wheras you desire we
        should be ingaged to aide you, upon all like occasions; we are perswaded
        you doe not doubte of it; yet as we now deale with you as a free people,
        and at libertie, so as we cannot draw you into this warr with us,
        otherwise then as reason may guid &amp; provock you; so we desire we may
        be at y<sup>e</sup> like freedome, when any occasion may call for help
        from us. And wheras it is objected to us, that we refused to aide you
        against y<sup>e</sup> French; we conceive y<sup>e</sup> case was not
        alicke; yet we cannot wholy excuse our failing in that matter. (4<sup>ly</sup>.)
        Weras you objecte that we began y<sup>e</sup> warr without your
        privitie, &amp; managed it contrary to your advise; the truth is, that
        our first intentions being only against Block Iland, and y<sup>e</sup>
        interprice seeming of small difficultie, we did not so much as consider
        of taking advice, or looking out for aide abroad. And when we had
        resolved upon y<sup>e</sup> Pequents, we sent presently, or not long
        after, to you aboute it; but y<sup>e</sup> answer received, it was not
        seasonable for us to chaing our counsells, excepte we had seen and
        waighed your grounds, which might have out wayed our owne.
      </p>
      <p>
        (5<sup>ly</sup>.) For our peoples trading at Kenebeck, we assure you (to
        our knowledge) it hath not been by any allowance from us; and what we
        have provided in this and like cases, at our last Courte, M<sup>r</sup>.
        E. W. can certifie you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And (6<sup>ly</sup>); wheras you objecte to us y<sup>t</sup> we should
        hold trade &amp; correspondancie with y<sup>e</sup> French, your
        enemise; we answer, you are misinformed, for, besids some letters which
        hath passed betweene our late Gov<sup>r</sup> and them, to which we were
        privie, we have neither sente nor incouraged ours to trade with them;
        only one vessell or tow, for y<sup>e</sup> better conve&#257;ce of our
        letters, had licens from our Gov<sup>r</sup> to sayle thither.<a

        other things have been privatly objected to us, by our worthy freind,
        wherunto he received some answer; but most of them concerning y<sup>e</sup>
        apprehention of perticuler discurteseis, or injueries from some
        perticuler persons amongst us. It concernes us not to give any other
        answer to them then this; that, if y<sup>e</sup> offenders shall be
        brought forth in a right way, we shall be ready to doe justice as y<sup>e</sup>
        case shall require. In the meane time, we desire you to rest assured,
        that such things are without our privity, and not a litle greeveous to

      <p>
        Now for y<sup>e</sup> joyning with us in this warr, which indeed
        concerns us no other wise then it may your selves, viz.: the releeving
        of our freinds &amp; Christian [222] breethren, who are now first in y<sup>e</sup>
        danger; though you may thinke us able to make it good without you, (as,
        if y<sup>e</sup> Lord please to be with us, we may,) yet 3. things we
        offer to your consideration, which (we conceive) may have some waight
        with you. (First) y<sup>t</sup> if we should sinck under this burden,
        your opportunitie of seasonable help would be lost in 3. respects. 1.
        You cannot recover us, or secure your selves ther, with 3. times y<sup>e</sup>
        charge &amp; hazard which now y<sup>e</sup> may. 2<sup>ly</sup>. The
        sorrowes which we should lye under (if through your neglect) would much
        abate of y<sup>e</sup> acceptablenes of your help afterwards. 3<sup>ly</sup>.
        Those of yours who are now full of courage and forwardnes, would be much
        damped, and so less able to undergoe so great a burden. The (2.) thing
        is this, that it concernes us much to hasten this warr to an end before
        y<sup>e</sup> end of this somer, otherwise y<sup>e</sup> newes of it
        will discourage both your &amp; our freinds from coming to us next year;
        with what further hazard &amp; losse it may expose us unto, your selves
        may judge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The (3.) thing is this, that if y<sup>e</sup> Lord shall please to
        blesse our endeaours, so as we end y<sup>e</sup> warr, or put it in a
        hopefull way without you, it may breed such ill thoughts in our people
        towards yours, as will be hard to entertaine <span class="pagenum"><a

        will towards us, as were fitt to be nurished among such neigbours &amp;
        brethren as we are. And what ill consequences may follow, on both sids,
        wise men may fear, &amp; would rather prevente then hope to redress. So

      In y<sup>e</sup> mean time, the Pequents, espetially in y<sup>e</sup>
      winter before, sought to make peace with y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets, and
      used very pernicious arguments to move them therunto: as that y<sup>e</sup>
      English were stranegers and begane to overspred their countrie, and would
      deprive them therof in time, if they were suffered to grow &amp; increse;
      and if y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets did assist y<sup>e</sup> English to
      subdue them, they did but make way for their owne overthrow, for if they
      were rooted out, the English would soone take occasion to subjugate them;
      and if they would harken to them, they should not neede to fear y<sup>e</sup>
      strength of y<sup>e</sup> English; for they would not come to open battle
      with them, but fire their houses, kill their katle, and lye in ambush for
      them as they went abroad upon their occasions; and all this they might
      easily doe without any or litle danger to them selves. The which course
      being held, they well saw the English could not long subsiste, but they
      would either be starved with hunger, or be forced to forsake the countrie;
      with many y<sup>e</sup> like things; insomuch <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>that y<sup>e</sup>
      Narigansets were once wavering, and were halfe minded to have made peace
      with them, and joy&#773;ed against y<sup>e</sup> English. But againe when
      they considered, how much wrong they had received from the Pequents, and
      what an oppertunitie they now had by y<sup>e</sup> help of y<sup>e</sup>
      English to right them selves, revenge was so sweete unto them, as it
      prevailed above all y<sup>e</sup> rest; so as they resolved to joyne with
      y<sup>e</sup> English against them, &amp; did. [223] The Court here agreed
      forwith to send 50. men at their owne charg; and w<sup>th</sup> as much
      speed as posiblie they could, gott them armed, and had made them ready
      under sufficiente leaders, and provided a barke to carrie them provisions
      &amp; tend upon them for all occasions; but when they were ready to march
      (with a supply from y<sup>e</sup> Bay) they had word to stay, for y<sup>e</sup>
      enimy was as good as vanquished, and their would be no neede.

      I shall not take upon me exactly to describe their proceedings in these
      things, because I expecte it will be fully done by them selves, who best
      know the carrage &amp; circumstances of things; I shall therfore but touch
      them in generall. From Connightecute (who were most sencible of y<sup>e</sup>
      hurt sustained, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> present danger), they sett out a
      partie of men, and an other partie mett them from y<sup>e</sup> Bay, at y<sup>e</sup>
      Narigansets, who were to joyne with them. Y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets were
      ernest to be gone before y<sup>e</sup> English were well rested and
      refreshte, espetially some of them which came last. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>It should seeme their desire
      was to come upon y<sup>e</sup> enemie sudenly, &amp; undiscovered. Ther
      was a barke of this place, newly put in ther, which was come from
      Conightecutte, who did incourage them to lay hold of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans
      forwardnes, and to shew as great forwardnes as they, for it would incorage
      them, and expedition might prove to their great advantage. So they went
      on, and so ordered their march, as the Indeans brought them to a forte of
      y<sup>e</sup> enimies (in which most of their cheefe men were) before day.
      They approached y<sup>e</sup> same with great silence, and surrounded it
      both with English &amp; Indeans, that they might not breake out; and so
      assualted them with great courage, shooting amongst them, and entered y<sup>e</sup>
      forte with all speed; and those y<sup>t</sup> first entered found sharp
      resistance from the enimie, who both shott at &amp; grapled with them;
      others rane into their howses, &amp; brought out fire, and sett them on
      fire, which soone tooke in their matts, &amp;, standing close togeather,
      with y<sup>e</sup> wind, all was quickly on a flame, and therby more were
      burnte to death then was otherwise slain; it burnte their bowstrings, and
      made them unservisable. Those y<sup>t</sup> scaped y<sup>e</sup> fire were
      slaine with y<sup>e</sup> sword; some hewed to peeces, others rune throw
      with their rapiers, so as they were quickly dispatchte, and very few
      escaped. It was conceived they thus destroyed about 400. at this time. It
      was a fearfull sight to see them thus frying in y<sup>e</sup> fyer, and y<sup>e</sup>
      streams of blood <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>quenching
      y<sup>e</sup> same, and horrible was y<sup>e</sup> stinck &amp; sente ther
      of; but y<sup>e</sup> victory seemed a sweete sacrifice, and they gave the
      prays therof to God, who had wrought so wonderfuly for them, thus to
      inclose their enimise in their hands, and give them so speedy a victory
      over so proud &amp; insulting an enimie. The Narigansett Indeans, all this
      while, stood round aboute, but aloofe from all danger, and left y<sup>e</sup>
      whole [224] execution to y<sup>e</sup> English, exept it were y<sup>e</sup>
      stoping of any y<sup>t</sup> broke away, insulting over their enimies in
      this their ruine &amp; miserie, when they saw them dancing in y<sup>e</sup>
      flames, calling them by a word in their owne language, signifing, O brave
      Pequents! which they used familierly among them selves in their own
      prayes, in songs of triumph after their victories. After this servis was
      thus happily accomplished, they marcht to the water side, wher they mett
      with some of their vesells, by which they had refreishing with victualls
      &amp; other necessaries. But in their march y<sup>e</sup> rest of y<sup>e</sup>
      Pequents drew into a body, and acoasted them, thinking to have some
      advantage against them by<a name="FNanchor_DX_128" id="FNanchor_DX_128"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_DX_128" class="fnanchor">[DX]</a> reason of a neck of
      land; but when they saw the English prepare for them, they kept a loofe,
      so as they neither did hurt, nor could receive any. After their
      refreishing &amp; repair to geather for further counsell &amp; directions,
      they resolved to pursue their victory, and follow y<sup>e</sup> warr
      against y<sup>e</sup> rest, but y<sup>e</sup> Narigansett Indeans <span

      them forsooke them, and such of them as they had with them for guids, or
      otherwise, they found them very could and backward in y<sup>e</sup>

      English would make more profite of y<sup>e</sup> victorie then they were

        Worthy S<sup>r</sup>: I received your loving letter, and am much
        provocked to express my affections towards you, but straitnes of time
        forbids me; for my desire is to acquainte you with y<sup>e</sup> Lords
        greate mercies towards us, in our prevailing against his &amp; our
        enimies; that you may rejoyce and praise his name with us. About 80. of
        our men, haveing costed along towards y<sup>e</sup> Dutch plantation,
        (some times by water, but most by land,) mett hear &amp; ther with some
        Pequents, whom they slew or tooke prisoners. 2. sachems they tooke,
        &amp; beheaded; and not hearing of Sassacous, (the cheefe sachem,) they
        gave a prisoner his life, to goe and find him out. He wente and brought
        them word where he was, but Sassacouse, suspecting him to be a spie,
        after he was gone, fled away with some 20. more to y<sup>e</sup>
        Mowakes, so our men missed of him. Yet, deviding them selves, and
        ranging up &amp; downe, as y<sup>e</sup> providence of God guided them
        (for y<sup>e</sup> Indeans were all gone, save 3. or 4. and they knew
        not whither to guid them, or els would not), upon y<sup>e</sup> 13. of
        this month, they light upon a great company of them, viz. 80. strong
        men, &amp; 200. women &amp; children, in a small Indean <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>towne,
        fast by a hideous swamp, which they all slipped into before our men
        could gett to them. Our captains were not then come togeither, but ther
        was M<sup>r</sup>. Ludlow and Captaine Masson, with some 10. [225] of
        their men, &amp; Captaine Patrick with some 20. or more of his, who,
        shooting at y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, Captaine Trask with 50. more came
        soone in at y<sup>e</sup> noyse. Then they gave order to surround y<sup>e</sup>
        swampe, it being aboute a mile aboute; but Levetenante Davenporte &amp;
        some 12. more, not hearing that com&#773;and, fell into y<sup>e</sup>
        swampe among y<sup>e</sup> Indeans. The swampe was so thicke with
        shrub-woode, &amp; so boggie with all, that some of them stuck fast, and
        received many shott. Levetenant Davenport was dangerously wounded aboute
        his armehole, and another shott in y<sup>e</sup> head, so as, fainting,
        they were in great danger to have been taken by y<sup>e</sup> Indeans.
        But Sargante Rigges, &amp; Jeffery, and 2. or 3. more, rescued them, and
        slew diverse of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans with their swords. After they were
        drawne out, the Indeans desired parley, &amp; were offered (by Thomas
        Stanton, our interpretour) that, if they would come out, and yeeld them
        selves, they should have their lives, all that had not their hands in y<sup>e</sup>
        English blood. Wherupon y<sup>e</sup> sachem of y<sup>e</sup> place came
        forth, and an old man or 2. &amp; their wives and children, and after
        that some other women &amp; children, and so they spake 2. howers, till
        it was night. Then Thomas Stanton was sente into them againe, to call
        them forth; but they said they would selle their lives their, and so
        shott at him so thicke as, if he had not cried out, and been presently
        rescued, they had slaine him. Then our men cutt of a place of y<sup>e</sup>
        swampe with their swords, and cooped the Indeans into so narrow a
        compass, as they could easier kill them throw y<sup>e</sup> thickets. So
        they continued all y<sup>e</sup> night, standing aboute 12. foote one
        from an other, and y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, coming close up to our men,
        shot their arrows so thicke, as they pierced their hatte brimes, &amp;
        their sleeves, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>&amp;
        stockins, &amp; other parts of their cloaths, yet so miraculously did
        the Lord preserve them as not one of them was wounded, save those 3. who
        rashly went into y<sup>e</sup> swampe. When it was nere day, it grue
        very darke, so as those of them which were left dropt away betweene our
        men, though they stood but 12. or 14. foote assunder; but were presenly
        discovered, &amp; some killed in y<sup>e</sup> pursute. Upon searching
        of y<sup>e</sup> swampe, y<sup>e</sup> next morning, they found 9.
        slaine, &amp; some they pulled up, whom y<sup>e</sup> Indeans had buried
        in y<sup>e</sup> mire, so as they doe thinke that, of all this company,
        not 20. did escape, for they after found some who dyed in their flight
        of their wounds received. The prisoners were devided, some to those of y<sup>e</sup>
        river, and the rest to us. Of these we send y<sup>e</sup> male children
        to Bermuda,<a name="FNanchor_DY_129" id="FNanchor_DY_129"></a><a

        disposed aboute in the townes. Ther have been now slaine &amp; taken, in
        all, aboute 700. The rest are dispersed, and the Indeans in all quarters
        so terrified as all their friends are affraid to receive them. 2. of y<sup>e</sup>
        sachems of Long Iland came to M<sup>r</sup>. Stoughton and tendered them
        selves to be tributaries under our protection. And 2. of y<sup>e</sup>
        Neepnett sachems have been with me to seeke our frendship. Amonge the
        prisoners we have y<sup>e</sup> wife &amp; children of Mononotto, a
        womon of a very modest countenance and behaviour. It was by her
        mediation that the<a name="FNanchor_DZ_130" id="FNanchor_DZ_130"></a><a

        were spared from death, and were kindly used by her; so that I have
        taken charge of her. One of her first requests was, that the English
        would not abuse her body, and that her children might not be taken from
        her. Those which were wounded were fetched of soone by John Galopp, who
        came with his shalop in a happie houre, to bring them victuals, and to
        carrie their wounded men to y<sup>e</sup> pinass, wher our cheefe
        surgeon was, w<sup>th</sup> M<sup>r</sup>. <span class="pagenum"><a

        This is y<sup>e</sup> substance of that which I received, though I am

      That I may make an end of this matter: this Sassacouse (y<sup>e</sup>

      his head, with some other of y<sup>e</sup> cheefe of them, whether to
      satisfie y<sup>e</sup> English, or rather y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets, (who,
      as I have since heard, hired them to doe it,) or for their owne advantage,
      I well know not; but thus this warr tooke end. The rest of y<sup>e</sup>
      Pequents were wholy driven from their place, and some of them submitted
      them selves to y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets, &amp; lived under them; others

      Narrigansetts, that they had not y<sup>e</sup> whole sweay over them, as
      they have never ceased plotting and contriving how to bring them under,

      They had now letters againe out of England from M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews

      that they had sent all to M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley, &amp; none to them
      selves. Now, though they might have justly referred them to their former
      answer, and insisted ther upon, &amp; some wise men counselled them so to
      doe, yet because they beleeved that [227] they were realy out round sumes

      beleeve it, they should find it true. And he was as good as his word, for
      they could never gett peney from him, nor bring him to any accounte,
      though Mr. Beachamp sued him in y<sup>e</sup> Chancerie. But they all of

      they never had, nor drunke for; and now in paying all, &amp; more then all
      (as they conceived), and yet still thus more demanded, and that with many
      heavie charges. They now discharged M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley from his

      Amongst other enormities that fell out amongst them, this year 3. men were
      (after due triall) executed for robery &amp; murder which they had
      committed; their names were these, Arthur Peach, Thomas Jackson, and
      Richard Stinnings; ther was a 4., Daniel Crose, who was also guilty, but
      he escaped away, and could not be found. This Arthur Peach was y<sup>e</sup>
      cheefe of them, and y<sup>e</sup> ring leader of all y<sup>e</sup> rest.
      He was a lustie and a desperate yonge man, and had been one of y<sup>e</sup>
      souldiers in y<sup>e</sup> Pequente warr, and had done as good servise as
      y<sup>e</sup> most ther, and one of y<sup>e</sup> forwardest in any
      attempte. And being now out of means, and loath to worke, and falling to
      idle courses &amp; company, he intended to goe to y<sup>e</sup> Dutch
      plantation; and had alured these 3., being other mens servants and
      apprentices, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>to
      goe with him. But another cause ther was allso of his secret going away in
      this maner; he was not only rune into debte, but he had gott a maid with
      child, (which was not known till after his death,) a mans servante in y<sup>e</sup>
      towne, and fear of punishmente made him gett away. The other 3.
      complotting with him, ranne away from their maisters in the night, and
      could not be heard of, for they went not y<sup>e</sup> ordinarie way, but
      shaped such a course as they thought to avoyd y<sup>e</sup> pursute of any
      [228]. But falling into y<sup>e</sup> way that lyeth betweene y<sup>e</sup>
      Bay of Massachusetts and the Narrigansets, and being disposed to rest them
      selves, struck fire, and took tobaco, a litle out of y<sup>e</sup> way, by
      y<sup>e</sup> way side. At length ther came a Narigansett Indean by, who
      had been in y<sup>e</sup> Bay a trading, and had both cloth &amp; beads
      aboute him. (They had meett him y<sup>e</sup> day before, &amp; he was now
      returning.) Peach called him to drinke tobaco with them, and he came &amp;
      sate downe with them. Peach tould y<sup>e</sup> other he would kill him,
      and take what he had from him. But they were some thing afraid; but he
      said, Hang him, rogue, he had killed many of them. So they let him alone
      to doe as he would; and when he saw his time, he tooke a rapier and rane
      him through the body once or twise, and tooke from him 5. fathume of
      wampam, and 3. coats of cloath, and wente their way, leaving him for dead.
      But he scrabled away, when they were gone, and made shift to gett home,
      (but dyed within <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>a
      few days after,) by which means they were discovered; and by subtilty the
      Indeans tooke them. For they desiring a canow to sett them over a water,
      (not thinking their facte had been known,) by y<sup>e</sup> sachems
      command they were carried to Aquidnett Iland, &amp; ther accused of y<sup>e</sup>
      murder, and were examend &amp; comitted upon it by y<sup>e</sup> English
      ther. The Indeans sent for M<sup>r</sup>. Williams, &amp; made a greeveous
      complainte; his freinds and kinred were ready to rise in armes, and
      provock the rest therunto, some conceiving they should now find y<sup>e</sup>
      Pequents words trew: that y<sup>e</sup> English would fall upon them. But
      M<sup>r</sup>. Williams pacified them, &amp; tould them, they should see
      justice done upon y<sup>e</sup> offenders; &amp; wente to y<sup>e</sup>
      man, &amp; tooke M<sup>r</sup>. James, a phisition, with him. The man
      tould him who did it, &amp; in what maner it was done; but the phisition
      found his wounds mortall, and that he could not live, (as he after
      testified upon othe, before the jurie in oppen courte,) and so he dyed
      shortly after, as both Mr. Williams, M<sup>r</sup>. James, &amp; some
      Indeans testified in courte. The Gov<sup>rt</sup> in the Bay were aquented
      with it, but refferrd it hither, because it was done in this jurisdiction;<a

      might be done in it; or els y<sup>e</sup> countrie must rise &amp; see
      justice done, otherwise it would raise a warr. Yet some of y<sup>e</sup>

      the Indean accused them of, &amp; that they had done it, in y<sup>e</sup>
      maner afforesaid; and so, upon y<sup>e</sup> forementioned evidence, were
      cast by y<sup>e</sup> jurie, &amp; condemned, &amp; executed for the same.
      And some of y<sup>e</sup> Narigansett Indeans, &amp; of y<sup>e</sup>

      y<sup>e</sup> countrie good satisfaction. But it was a matter of much
      sadnes to them hear, and was y<sup>e</sup> 2. execution which they had
      since they came; being both for wilfull murder, as hath bene before
      related. Thus much of this mater.
    </p>
    <p>
      [229] They received this year more letters from England full of reneued
      complaints, on y<sup>e</sup> one side, that they could gett no money nor
      accounte from M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley; &amp; he againe, y<sup>t</sup> he
      was pressed therto, saying he was to accounte with those hear, and not
      with them, &amp;c. So, as was before resolved, if nothing came of their
      last letters, they would now send them what they could, as supposing, when
      some good parte was payed them, that M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley &amp; they
      would more easily agree aboute y<sup>e</sup> remainder.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they sent to M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews and M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp, by M<sup>r</sup>.
      Joseph Yonge, in y<sup>e</sup> Mary &amp; Anne, 1325<sup>li</sup>. waight
      of beaver, devided betweene them. M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp returned an
      accounte of his moyety, that he made 400<sup>li</sup>. <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>starling
      of it, fraight and all charges paid. But M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews, though he
      had y<sup>e</sup> more and beter parte, yet he made not so much of his,
      through his owne indiscretion; and yet turned y<sup>e</sup> loss<a
      name="FNanchor_EC_133" id="FNanchor_EC_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_EC_133"
      class="fnanchor">[EC]</a> upon them hear, but without cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sent them more by bills &amp; other paimente, which was received
      &amp; acknowledged by them, in money<a name="FNanchor_ED_134"
      id="FNanchor_ED_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_ED_134" class="fnanchor">[ED]</a>
      &amp; y<sup>e</sup> like; which was for katle sould of M<sup>r</sup>.
      Allertons, and y<sup>e</sup> price of a bark sold, which belonged to y<sup>e</sup>
      stock, and made over to them in money, 434<sup>li</sup>. sterling. The
      whole sume was 1234<sup>li</sup>. sterling, save what M<sup>r</sup>.
      Andrews lost in y<sup>e</sup> beaver, which was otherwise made good. But
      yet this did not stay their clamors, as will apeare here after more at
      large.
    </p>
    <p>
      It pleased God, in these times, so to blesse y<sup>e</sup> cuntry with
      such access &amp; confluance of people into it, as it was therby much
      inriched, and catle of all kinds stood at a high rate for diverce years
      together. Kine were sould at 20<sup>li</sup>. and some at 25<sup>li</sup>.
      a peece, yea, some times at 28<sup>li</sup>. A cow-calfe usually at 10<sup>li</sup>.
      A milch goate at 3<sup>li</sup>. &amp; some at 4<sup>li</sup>. And femall
      kids at 30<sup>s</sup>. and often at 40<sup>s</sup>. a peece. By which
      means y<sup>e</sup> anciente planters which had any stock begane to grow
      in their estats. Corne also wente at a round rate, viz. 6<sup>s</sup>. a
      bushell. So as other trading begane to be neglected; and the old partners
      (having now forbidden M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley to send them any more goods)
      broke of their trade at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437"
      id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>Kenebeck, and, as things stood, would follow
      it no longer. But some of them, (with other they joyned with,) being loath
      it should be lost by discontinuance, agreed with y<sup>e</sup> company for
      it, and gave them aboute y<sup>e</sup> 6. parte of their gaines for it;
      [230]<a name="FNanchor_EE_135" id="FNanchor_EE_135"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_EE_135" class="fnanchor">[EE]</a> with y<sup>e</sup> first
      fruits of which they builte a house for a prison; and the trade ther hath
      been since continued, to y<sup>e</sup> great benefite of y<sup>e</sup>
      place; for some well fore-sawe that these high prises of corne and catle
      would not long continue, and that then y<sup>e</sup> com&#773;odities ther
      raised would be much missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year, aboute y<sup>e</sup> 1. or 2. of June, was a great &amp;
      fearfull earthquake; it was in this place heard before it was felte. It
      came with a rumbling noyse, or low murmure, like unto remoate thunder; it
      came from y<sup>e</sup> norward, &amp; pased southward. As y<sup>e</sup>
      noyse aproched nerer, they earth begane to shake, and came at length with
      that violence as caused platters, dishes, &amp; such like things as stoode
      upon shelves, to clatter &amp; fall downe; yea, persons were afraid of y<sup>e</sup>
      houses them selves. It so fell oute y<sup>t</sup> at y<sup>e</sup> same
      time diverse of y<sup>e</sup> cheefe of this towne were mett together at
      one house, conferring with some of their freinds that were upon their
      removall from y<sup>e</sup> place, (as if y<sup>e</sup> Lord would herby
      shew y<sup>e</sup> signes of his displeasure, in their shaking a peeces
      &amp; removalls one from an other.) How ever it was very terrible for y<sup>e</sup>
      time, and as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup>
      men were set talking in y<sup>e</sup> house, some women &amp; others were
      without y<sup>e</sup> dores, and y<sup>e</sup> earth shooke with y<sup>t</sup>
      violence as they could not stand without catching hould of y<sup>e</sup>
      posts &amp; pails y<sup>t</sup> stood next them; but y<sup>e</sup>
      violence lasted not long. And about halfe an hower, or less, came an other
      noyse &amp; shaking, but nether so loud nor strong as y<sup>e</sup>
      former, but quickly passed over; and so it ceased. It was not only on y<sup>e</sup>
      sea coast, but y<sup>e</sup> Indeans felt it within land; and some ships
      that were upon y<sup>e</sup> coast were shaken by it. So powerfull is y<sup>e</sup>
      mighty hand of y<sup>e</sup> Lord, as to make both the earth &amp; sea to
      shake, and the mountaines to tremble before him, when he pleases; and who
      can stay his hand? It was observed that y<sup>e</sup> som&#773;ers, for
      divers years togeather after this earthquake, were not so hotte &amp;
      seasonable for y<sup>e</sup> ripning of corne &amp; other fruits as
      formerly; but more could &amp; moyst, &amp; subjecte to erly &amp; untimly
      frosts, by which, many times, much Indean corne came not to maturitie; but
      whether this was any cause, I leave it to naturallists to judge.

      These 2. years I joyne togeather, because in them fell not out many things
      more then y<sup>e</sup> ordinary passages of their com&#773;one affaires,
      which are not needfull to be touched. [231] Those of this plantation
      having at sundrie times granted lands for severall <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>townships, and amongst y<sup>e</sup>
      rest to y<sup>e</sup> inhabitants of Sityate, some wherof issewed from
      them selves, and allso a large tracte of land was given to their 4. London
      partners in y<sup>e</sup> place, viz. M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley, M<sup>r</sup>.
      Beacham, M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews, &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Hatherley. At M<sup>r</sup>.
      Hatherley's request and choys it was by him taken for him selfe and them
      in y<sup>t</sup> place; for the other 3. had invested him with power &amp;
      trust to chose for them. And this tracte of land extended to their utmoste
      limets that way, and bordered on their neigbours of y<sup>e</sup>
      Massachusets, who had some years after seated a towne (called Hingam) on
      their lands next to these parts. So as now ther grue great differance
      betweene these 2. townships, about their bounds, and some meadow grownds
      that lay betweene them. They of Hingam presumed to alotte parte of them to
      their people, and measure &amp; stack them out. The other pulled up their
      stacks, &amp; threw them. So it grew to a controversie betweene the 2.
      goverments, &amp; many letters and passages were betweene them aboute it;
      and it hunge some 2. years in suspense. The Courte of Massachusets,
      appointed some to range their line according to y<sup>e</sup> bounds of
      their patente, and (as they wente to worke) they made it to take in all
      Sityate, and I know not how much more. Againe, on y<sup>e</sup> other
      hand, according to y<sup>e</sup> line of the patente of this place, it
      would take in Hingame and much more within their bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In y<sup>e</sup> end boath Courts agreed to chose 2. comissioners of each
      side, and to give them full &amp; absolute power to agree and setle y<sup>e</sup>
      bounds betwene them; and what they should doe in y<sup>e</sup> case should
      stand irrevocably. One meeting they had at Hingam, but could not conclude;
      for their comissioners stoode stiffly on a clawes in their graunte, That
      from Charles-river, or any branch or parte therof, they were to extend
      their limits, and 3. myles further to y<sup>e</sup> southward; or from y<sup>e</sup>
      most southward parte of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets Bay, and 3. mile
      further. But they chose to stand on y<sup>e</sup> former termes, for they
      had found a smale river, or brooke rather, that a great way with in land
      trended southward, and issued into some part of y<sup>t</sup> river taken
      to be Charles-river, and from y<sup>e</sup> most southerly part of this,
      &amp; 3. mile more southward of y<sup>e</sup> same, they would rune a line
      east to y<sup>e</sup> sea, aboute 20. mile; which will (say they) take in
      a part of Plimoth itselfe. Now it is to be knowne y<sup>t</sup> though
      this patente &amp; plantation were much the ancienter, yet this
      inlargemente of the same (in which Sityate stood) was granted after
      theirs, and so theirs were first to take place, before this inlargmente.
      Now their answer was, first, that, however according to their owne plan,
      they could noway come upon any part of their ancieante grante. [232]
      Secondly. They could never prove y<sup>t</sup> to be a parte of
      Charles-river, for they knew not which was Charles-river, but as y<sup>e</sup>
      people of this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>place,
      which came first, imposed such a name upon y<sup>t</sup> river, upon
      which, since, Charles-towne is builte (supposing y<sup>t</sup> was it,
      which Captaine Smith in his mapp so named). Now they y<sup>t</sup> first
      named it have best reason to know it, and to explaine which is it. But
      they only tooke it to be Charles river, as fare as it was by them
      navigated, and y<sup>t</sup> was as farr as a boate could goe. But y<sup>t</sup>
      every runlett or small brooke, y<sup>t</sup> should, farr within land,
      come into it, or mixe their stremes with it, and were by y<sup>e</sup>
      natives called by other &amp; differente names from it, should now by them
      be made Charles-river, or parts of it, they saw no reason for it. And gave
      instance in Humber, in Old England, which had y<sup>e</sup> Trente, Ouse,
      and many others of lesser note fell into it, and yet were not counted
      parts of it; and many smaler rivers &amp; broks fell into y<sup>e</sup>
      Trente, &amp; Ouse, and no parts of them, but had nams aparte, and
      divisions &amp; nominations of them selves. Againe, it was pleaded that
      they had no east line in their patente, but were to begine at y<sup>e</sup>
      sea, and goe west by a line, &amp;c. At this meeting no conclution was
      made, but things discussed &amp; well prepared for an issue. The next year
      y<sup>e</sup> same com&#773;issioners had their power continued or
      renewed, and mett at Sityate, and concluded y<sup>e</sup> mater, as

      [235] In these 2. years they had sundry letters out of England to send one
      over to end the buissines and accounte with M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley; who
      now professed he could not make up his accounts without y<sup>e</sup> help
      of some from hence, espetialy M<sup>r</sup>. Winslows. They had serious
      thoughts of it, and y<sup>e</sup> most parte of y<sup>e</sup> partners
      hear thought it best to send; but they had formerly written such bitter
      and threatening letters as M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow was neither willing to
      goe, nor y<sup>t</sup> any other of y<sup>e</sup> partners should; for he
      was perswaded, if any of them wente, they should be arested, and an action
      of such a sum&#773;e layed upon them as they should not procure baele, but
      must lye in prison, and then they would bring them to what they liste; or
      other wise they might be brought into trouble by y<sup>e</sup>
      arch-bishops means, as y<sup>e</sup> times then stood. But,
      notwithstanding, they weer much inclined to send, &amp; Captaine Standish
      was willing to goe, but they resolved, seeing they could not all agree in
      this thing, and that it was waighty, and y<sup>e</sup> consequence might
      prove dangerous, to take M<sup>r</sup>. Winthrops advise in y<sup>e</sup>
      thing, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>and
      y<sup>e</sup> rather, because M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews had by many letters
      acquaynted him with y<sup>e</sup> differences betweene them, and appoynted
      him for his assigne to receive his parte of y<sup>e</sup> debte. (And
      though they deneyed to pay him any as a debte, till y<sup>e</sup>
      controversie was ended, yet they had deposited 110<sup>li</sup>. in money
      in his hands for M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews, to pay to him in parte as soone
      as he would come to any agreement with y<sup>e</sup> rest.) But M<sup>r</sup>.
      Winthrop was of M<sup>r</sup>. Winslows minde, and disswaded them from
      sending; so they broak of their resolution from sending, and returned this
      answer: that the times were dangerous as things stood with them, for they
      knew how M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow had suffered formerley, and for a small
      matter was clapte up in y<sup>e</sup> Fleete, &amp; it was long before he
      could gett out, to both his &amp; their great loss and damage; and times
      were not better, but worse, in y<sup>t</sup> respecte. Yet, that their
      equall &amp; honest minds might appeare to all men, they made them this
      tender: to refferr y<sup>e</sup> case to some gentle-men and marchants in
      y<sup>e</sup> Bay of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusetts, such as they should
      chuse, and were well knowne unto them selves, (as they perceived their wer
      many of their aquaintance and freinds ther, better knowne to them then y<sup>e</sup>
      partners hear,) and let them be informed in y<sup>e</sup> case by both
      sids, and have all y<sup>e</sup> evidence y<sup>t</sup> could be prodused,
      in writing, or other wise; and they would be bound to stand to their
      determination, and make good their <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448"
      id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>award, though it should cost them all they
      had in y<sup>e</sup> world. But this did not please them, but they were
      offended at it, without any great reasone for ought I know, (seeing nether
      side could give in clear accountes, y<sup>e</sup> partners here could not,
      by reason they (to their smarte) were failed by y<sup>e</sup> accountante
      they sent them, and M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley pretened he could not allso,)
      save as they conceived it a disparagmente to yeeld to their inferiours in
      respecte of y<sup>e</sup> place and other concurring circomstances. So
      this came to nothing; and afterward M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley write, y<sup>t</sup>
      if M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow would mett him in France, y<sup>e</sup>
      Low-Countries, or Scotland, let y<sup>e</sup> place be knowne, and he
      [236] come to him ther. But in regard of y<sup>e</sup> troubles that now
      begane to arise in our owne nation, and other reasons, this did not come
      to any effecte. That which made them so desirous to bring things to an end
      was partly to stope y<sup>e</sup> clamours and aspertions raised &amp;
      cast upon them hereaboute; though they conceived them selves to sustaine
      the greatest wrong, and had most cause of complainte; and partly because
      they feared y<sup>e</sup> fall of catle, in which most parte of their
      estats lay. And this was not a vaine feare; for they fell indeede before
      they came to a conclusion, and that so souddanly, as a cowe that but a
      month before was worth 20<sup>li</sup>., and would so have passed in any
      paymente, fell now to 5<sup>li</sup>. and would yeeld no more; and a goate
      that wente at 3<sup>li</sup>. or 50<sup>s</sup>. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>would now yeeld but 8. or 10<sup>s</sup>.
      at most. All men feared a fall of catle, but it was thought it would be by
      degrees; and not to be from y<sup>e</sup> highest pitch at once to y<sup>e</sup>
      lowest, as it did, which was greatly to y<sup>e</sup> damage of many, and
      y<sup>e</sup> undoing of some. An other reason was, they many of them grew
      aged, (and indeed a rare thing it was that so many partners should all
      live together so many years as these did,) and saw many changes were like
      to befall; so as they were loath to leave these intanglments upon their
      children and posteritie, who might be driven to remove places, as they had
      done; yea, them selves might doe it yet before they dyed. But this
      bussines must yet rest; y<sup>e</sup> next year gave it more ripnes,
      though it rendred them less able to pay, for y<sup>e</sup> reasons
      afforesaid.

      M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley being weary of this controversie, and desirous of

      M<sup>r</sup>. William Collier, 2. of y<sup>e</sup> inhabitants of this

        S<sup>r</sup>. My love remembered, &amp;c. I have writte so much
        concerning y<sup>e</sup> ending of accounts betweexte us, as I profess I
        know not what more to write, &amp;c. If you desire an end, as you seeme
        to doe, ther is (as I conceive) but 2. waise; that is, to parfecte all
        accounts, from y<sup>e</sup> first to y<sup>e</sup> last, &amp;c. Now if
        we find this difficulte, and tedious, haveing not been so stricte &amp;
        carefull as we should and oughte to have done, as for my owne parte I
        doe confess I have been somewhat to remisse, and doe verily thinke so
        are you, &amp;c. I fear you can never make a perfecte accounte of all

        second way must be, by biding, or [237] compounding; and this way, first
        or last, we must fall upon, &amp;c. If we must warr at law for it, doe
        not you expecte from me, nether will I from you, but to cleave y<sup>e</sup>
        heare, and then I dare say y<sup>e</sup> lawyers will be most gainers,
        &amp;c. Thus let us set to y<sup>e</sup> worke, one way or other, and
        end, that I may not allways suffer in my name &amp; estate. And you are
        not free; nay, y<sup>e</sup> gospell suffers by your delaying, and
        causeth y<sup>e</sup> professors of it to be hardly spoken of, that you,
        being many, &amp; now able, should combine &amp; joyne togeather to
        oppress &amp; burden me, &amp;c. Fear not to make a faire &amp;
        reasonable offer; beleeve me, I will never take any advantage to plead
        it against you, or to wrong you; or else let M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow come
        over, and let him have such full power &amp; authority as we may ende by
        compounding; or else, y<sup>e</sup> accounts so well and fully made up,
        as we may end by reconing. Now, blesed be God, y<sup>e</sup> times be
        much changed here, I hope to see many of you returne to you<sup>r</sup>
        native countrie againe, and have such freedome &amp; libertie as y<sup>e</sup>

      Being thus by this leter, and allso by M<sup>r</sup>. Atwodes &amp; M<sup>r</sup>.
      Colliers mediation urged to bring things to an end, (and y<sup>e</sup>
      continuall clamors from y<sup>e</sup> rest,) and by none more urged then
      by their own desires, they tooke this course (because many scandals had
      been raised upon them). They apoynted these 2. men before mentioned to
      meet on a certaine day, and called some other freinds on both sids, and M<sup>r</sup>.
      Free-man, brother in law to M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp, and having drawne up
      a collection of all y<sup>e</sup> remains of y<sup>e</sup> stock, in what
      soever it was, as housing, boats, bark, and all implements belonging to y<sup>e</sup>
      same, as they were used in y<sup>e</sup> time of y<sup>e</sup> trad, were
      they better or worce, with y<sup>e</sup> remaines of all com&#773;odities,
      as beads, knives, hatchetts, cloth, or any thing els, as well y<sup>e</sup>
      refuse as y<sup>e</sup> more vendible, with all debts, as well those y<sup>t</sup>
      were desperate as others more hopefull; and having spent diverce days to
      bring this to pass, having y<sup>e</sup> helpe of all bookes and papers,
      which either any of them selves had, or Josias Winslow, who was their
      accountante; and they found y<sup>e</sup> sume in all to arise (as y<sup>e</sup>
      things were valued) to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452"

      an other, and of all their frends, y<sup>e</sup> persons abovesaid y<sup>t</sup>
      were now presente, that this was all that any of them knew of, or could
      remember; and Josias Winslow did y<sup>e</sup> like for his parte. But y<sup>e</sup>
      truth is they wrongd them selves much in y<sup>e</sup> valuation, for they
      reconed some catle as they were taken of M<sup>r</sup>. Allerton, as for
      instance a cowe in y<sup>e</sup> hands of one cost 25<sup>li</sup>. and so
      she was valued in this accounte; but when she came to be past away in
      parte of paymente, after y<sup>e</sup> agreemente, she would be accepted
      but a 4<sup>li</sup>. 15<sup>s</sup>. [238] Also being tender of their
      oaths, they brought in all they know owing to y<sup>e</sup> stock; but
      they had not made y<sup>e</sup> like diligente search what y<sup>e</sup>
      stocke might owe to any, so as many scattering debts fell upon afterwards
      more then now they know of.

      I had forgoten to inserte in its place how y<sup>e</sup> church here had
      invited and sent for M<sup>r</sup>. Charles Chansey,<a
      name="FNanchor_EH_138" id="FNanchor_EH_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_EH_138"
      class="fnanchor">[EH]</a> a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457"
      id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>reverend, godly, and very larned man,
      intending upon triall to chose him pastor of y<sup>e</sup> church hear,
      for y<sup>e</sup> more comfortable performance of y<sup>e</sup> ministrie
      with Mr. John Reinor, the teacher of the same. But ther fell out some
      differance aboute baptising, he holding it ought only to be by diping, and
      putting y<sup>e</sup> whole body under water, and that sprinkling was
      unlawfull. The church yeelded that immersion, or dipping, was lawfull, but
      in this could countrie not so conveniente. But they could not nor durst
      not yeeld to him in this, that sprinkling (which all y<sup>e</sup>
      churches of Christ doe for y<sup>e</sup> most parte use at this day) was
      unlawfull, &amp; an humane invention, as y<sup>e</sup> same was prest; but
      they were willing to yeeld to him as far as y<sup>ey</sup> could, &amp; to
      y<sup>e</sup> utmost; and were contented to suffer him to practise as he
      was perswaded; and when he came to minister that ordnance, he might so doe
      it to any y<sup>t</sup> did desire it in y<sup>t</sup> way, provided he
      could peacably suffer Mr. Reinor, and such as desired to have theirs
      otherwise baptised by him, by sprinkling or powering on of water upon
      them; so as ther might be no disturbance in y<sup>e</sup> church
      hereaboute. But he said he could not yeeld herunto. Upon which the church
      procured some other ministers to dispute y<sup>e</sup> pointe with him
      publikly; as Mr. Ralfe Partrich, of Duxberie, who did it sundrie times,
      very ablie and sufficently, as allso some other ministers within this
      govermente. But he was not satisfied; so y<sup>e</sup> church sent to many
      other <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>churches
      to crave their help and advise in [241] this mater, and, with his will
      &amp; consente, sent them his arguments writen under his owne hand. They
      sente them to y<sup>e</sup> church at Boston in y<sup>e</sup> Bay of
      Massachusets, to be comunicated with other churches ther. Also they sent y<sup>e</sup>
      same to the churches of Conightecutt and New-Haven, with sundrie others;
      and received very able &amp; sufficent answers, as they conceived, from
      them and their larned ministers, who all concluded against him. But him
      selfe was not satisfied therw<sup>th</sup>. Their answers are too large
      hear to relate. They conceived y<sup>e</sup> church had done what was
      meete in y<sup>e</sup> thing, so M<sup>r</sup>. Chansey, having been y<sup>e</sup>
      most parte of 3. years here, removed him selfe to Sityate, wher he now
      remaines a minister to y<sup>e</sup> church ther. Also about these times,
      now y<sup>t</sup> catle &amp; other things begane greatly to fall from
      their former rates, and persons begane to fall into more straits, and many
      being allready gone from them, (as is noted before,) both to Duxberie,
      Marshfeeld, and other places, &amp; those of y<sup>e</sup> cheefe sorte,
      as M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow, Captaine Standish, Mr. Allden, and many other,
      &amp; stille some dropping away daly, and some at this time, and many more
      unsetled, it did greatly weaken y<sup>e</sup> place, and by reason of y<sup>e</sup>
      straitnes and barrennes of y<sup>e</sup> place, it sett y<sup>e</sup>
      thoughts of many upon removeall; as will appere more hereafter. <span

      Marvilous it may be to see and consider how some kind of wickednes did
      grow &amp; breake forth here, in a land wher the same was so much witnesed
      against, and so narrowly looked unto, &amp; severly punished when it was
      knowne; as in no place more, or so much, that I have known or heard of;
      insomuch as they have been somewhat censured, even by moderate and good
      men, for their severitie in punishments. And yet all this could not
      suppress y<sup>e</sup> breaking out of sundrie notorious sins, (as this
      year, besids other, gives us too many sad presidents and instances,)
      espetially drunkennes and unclainnes; not only incontinencie betweene
      persons unmaried, for which many both men &amp; women have been punished
      sharply enough, but some maried persons allso. But that which is worse,
      even sodomie and bugerie, (things fearfull to name,) have broak forth in
      this land, oftener then once. I say it may justly be marveled at, and
      cause us to fear &amp; tremble at the consideration of our corrupte
      natures, which are so hardly bridled, subdued, &amp; mortified; nay,
      cannot by any other means but y<sup>e</sup> powerfull worke &amp; grace of
      Gods spirite. But (besids this) one reason may be, that y<sup>e</sup>
      Divell may carrie a greater spite against the churches of Christ and y<sup>e</sup>
      gospell hear, by how much y<sup>e</sup> more they indeaour to preserve
      holynes and puritie amongst them, and strictly punisheth the contrary
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>when
      it ariseth either in church or comone wealth; that he might cast a [242]
      blemishe &amp; staine upon them in y<sup>e</sup> eyes of [y<sup>e</sup>]
      world, who use to be rash in judgmente. I would rather thinke thus, then
      that Satane hath more power in these heathen lands, as som have thought,
      then in more Christian nations, espetially over Gods servants in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. An other reason may be, that it may be in this case as it is with
      waters when their streames are stopped or dam&#773;ed up, when they gett
      passage they flow with more violence, and make more noys and disturbance,
      then when they are suffered to rune quietly in their owne chanels. So
      wikednes being here more stopped by strict laws, and y<sup>e</sup> same
      more nerly looked unto, so as it cannot rune in a comone road of liberty
      as it would, and is inclined, it searches every wher, and at last breaks
      out wher it getts vente.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. A third reason may be, hear (as I am verily perswaded) is not more
      evills in this kind, nor nothing nere so many by proportion, as in other
      places; but they are here more discoverd and seen, and made publick by due
      serch, inquisition, and due punishment; for y<sup>e</sup> churches looke
      narrowly to their members, and y<sup>e</sup> magistrats over all, more
      strictly then in other places. Besids, here the people are but few in
      comparison of other places, which are full &amp; populous, and lye hid, as
      it were, in a wood or thickett, and many horrible evills by y<sup>t</sup>
      means are never seen nor <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461"
      id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>knowne; wheras hear, they are, as it were,
      brought into y<sup>e</sup> light, and set in y<sup>e</sup> plaine feeld,
      or rather on a hill, made conspicuous to y<sup>e</sup> veiw of all.

    <p>
      But to proceede; y<sup>er</sup> came a letter from y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
      in y<sup>e</sup> Bay to them here, touching matters of y<sup>e</sup>

        S<sup>r</sup>: Having an opportunitie to signifie y<sup>e</sup> desires
        of our Generall Court in toow things of spetiall importance, I willingly
        take this occasion to imparte them to you, y<sup>t</sup> you may imparte
        them to y<sup>e</sup> rest of your magistrats, and also to your Elders,
        for counsell; and give us your advise in them. The first is concerning
        heinous offences in point of uncleannes; y<sup>e</sup> perticuler cases,
        with y<sup>e</sup> circomstances, and y<sup>e</sup> questions ther upon,
        you have hear inclosed. The 2. thing is concerning y<sup>e</sup>
        Ilanders at Aquidnett; y<sup>t</sup> seeing the cheefest of them are
        gone from us, in offences, either to churches, or com&#773;one welth, or
        both; others are dependants on them, and y<sup>e</sup> best sorte are
        such as close with them in all their rejections of us. Neither is it
        only in a faction y<sup>t</sup> they are devided from us, but in very
        deed they rend them selves from all y<sup>e</sup> true churches of
        Christ, and, many of them, from all y<sup>e</sup> powers of majestracie.
        We have had some experience hereof by some of their underworkers, or
        emissaries, who have latly come amongst us, and have made publick
        defiance against magistracie, ministrie, churches, &amp; church
        covenants, &amp;c. as antichristian; secretly also sowing y<sup>e</sup>
        seeds of Familisme, and Anabaptistrie, to y<sup>e</sup> infection of
        some, and danger of others; so that we are not willing to joyne with
        them in any league or confederacie at all, but rather that you would
        consider &amp; advise with us how we may avoyd them, and keep ours from
        being infected by them. Another thing I should mention <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>to you,
        for y<sup>e</sup> maintenance of y<sup>e</sup> trad of beaver; if ther
        be not a company to order it in every jurisdition among y<sup>e</sup>
        English, which companies should agree in generall of their way in trade,
        I supose that y<sup>e</sup> trade will be overthrowne, and the Indeans
        will abuse us. For this cause we have latly put it into order amongst
        us, hoping of incouragmente from you (as we have had) y<sup>t</sup> we
        may continue y<sup>e</sup> same. Thus not further to trouble you, I
        rest, with my loving remembrance to your selfe, &amp;c.

        [244] Worthy &amp; beloved S<sup>r</sup>:
      </p>
      <p>
        Your letter (with y<sup>e</sup> questions inclosed) I have comunicated
        with our Assistants, and we have refered y<sup>e</sup> answer of them to
        such Rev&#275;<sup>d</sup> Elders as are amongst us, some of whose
        answers thertoo we have here sent you inclosed, under their owne hands;
        from y<sup>e</sup> rest we have not yet received any. Our farr distance
        hath bene y<sup>e</sup> reason of this long delay, as also y<sup>t</sup>
        they could not conferr their counsells togeather.
      </p>
      <p>
        For our selves, (you know our breedings &amp; abillities,) we rather
        desire light from your selves, &amp; others, whom God hath better
        inabled, then to presume to give our judgments in cases so difficulte
        and of so high a nature. Yet under correction, and submission to better
        judgments, we propose this one thing to your prudent considerations. As
        it seems to us, in y<sup>e</sup> case even of willfull murder, that
        though a man did smite or wound an other, with a full pourpose or desire
        to kill him, (w<sup>ch</sup> is murder in a high degree, before God,)
        yet if he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>did
        not dye, the magistrate was not to take away y<sup>e</sup> others life.<a
        name="FNanchor_EJ_140" id="FNanchor_EJ_140"></a><a
        href="#Footnote_EJ_140" class="fnanchor">[EJ]</a> So by proportion in
        other grosse &amp; foule sines, though high attempts &amp; nere
        approaches to y<sup>e</sup> same be made, and such as in the sight &amp;
        account of God may be as ill as y<sup>e</sup> accomplishmente of y<sup>e</sup>
        foulest acts of y<sup>t</sup> sine, yet we doute whether it may be safe
        for y<sup>e</sup> magistrate to proceed to death; we thinke, upon y<sup>e</sup>
        former grounds, rather he may not. As, for instance, in y<sup>e</sup>
        case of adultrie, (if it be admitted y<sup>t</sup> it is to be punished
        w<sup>th</sup> death, which to some of us is not cleare,) if y<sup>e</sup>
        body be not actually defiled, then death is not to be inflicted. So in
        sodomie, &amp; beastialitie, if ther be not penetration. Yet we confess
        foulnes of circomstances, and frequencie in y<sup>e</sup> same, doth
        make us remaine in y<sup>e</sup> darke, and desire further light from
        you, or any, as God shall give.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for y<sup>e</sup> 2. thing, concerning y<sup>e</sup> Ilanders? we
        have no conversing with them, nor desire to have, furder then necessitie
        or humanity may require.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as for trade? we have as farr as we could ever therin held an
        orderly course, &amp; have been sory to see y<sup>e</sup> spoyle therof
        by others, and fear it will hardly be recovered. But in these, or any
        other things which may concerne y<sup>e</sup> com&#773;one good, we
        shall be willing to advise &amp; concure with you in what we may. Thus w<sup>th</sup>

    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        Qest: What sodmiticall acts are to be punished with death, &amp; what
        very facte (ipso facto) is worthy of death, or, if y<sup>e</sup> fact it
        selfe be not capitall, what circomstances concurring may make it
        capitall?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ans: In y<sup>e</sup> judiciall law (y<sup>e</sup> moralitie wherof
        concerneth us) it is manyfest y<sup>t</sup> carnall knowledg of man, or
        lying w<sup>th</sup> man, as with woman, cum penetratione corporis, was
        sodomie, to be punished with death; what els can be understood by Levit:
        18. 22. &amp; 20. 13. &amp; Gen: 19. 5? 2<sup>ly</sup>. It seems allso y<sup>t</sup>
        this foule sine might be capitall, though ther was not penitratio
        corporis, but only contactus &amp; fricatio usq&#771; ad effusionem
        seminis, for these reasons: [245] 1. Because it was sin to be punished
        with death, Levit. 20. 13. in y<sup>e</sup> man who was lyen withall, as
        well as in him y<sup>t</sup> lyeth with him; now his sin is not
        mitigated wher ther is not penitration, nor augmented wher it is; wheras
        its charged upon y<sup>e</sup> women, y<sup>t</sup> they were guilty of
        this unnaturall sine, as well as men, Rom. 1. 26. 27. Y<sup>e</sup> same
        thing doth furder apeare, 2. because of y<sup>t</sup> proportion
        betwexte this sin &amp; beastialitie, wherin if a woman did stand
        before, or aproach to, a beast, for y<sup>t</sup> end, to lye downe
        therto, (whether penetration was or not,) it was capitall, Levit: 18.
        23. &amp; 20. 16. 3<sup>ly</sup>. Because something els might be
        equivalent to penetration wher it had not been, viz. y<sup>e</sup> fore
        mentioned acts with frequencie and long continuance with a high hand,
        utterly extinguishing all light of nature; besids, full intention and
        bould attempting of y<sup>e</sup> foulest acts may seeme to have been
        capitall here, as well as coming presumptuously to slay with guile was
        capitall. Exod: 21. 14.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet it is not so manyfest y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> same acts were to
        be punished with death in some other sines of uncleannes, w<sup>ch</sup>
        yet by y<sup>e</sup> law of God were capitall crimes; besids other
        reasons, (1.) because sodomie, &amp; also beastialitie, is more against
        y<sup>e</sup> light of nature then some other capitall crimes of
        unclainnes, which reason is to be attended unto, as y<sup>t</sup> which

        this sin capitall; (2.) because it might be com&#773;ited with more
        secrecie &amp; less suspition, &amp; therfore needed y<sup>e</sup> more
        to be restrained &amp; suppresed by y<sup>e</sup> law; (3<sup>ly</sup>)
        because ther was not y<sup>e</sup> like reason &amp; degree of sin&#773;ing
        against family &amp; posteritie in this sin as in some other capitall
        sines of uncleannes.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Quest: How farr a magistrate may extracte a confession from a
        delinquente, to acuse him selfe of a capitall crime, seeing Nemo tenetur
        prodere seipsum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ans: A majestrate cannot without sin neglecte diligente inquision into y<sup>e</sup>
        cause brought before him. Job 29. 16. Pro: 24. 11. 12. &amp; 25. 2. (2<sup>ly</sup>.)
        If it be manifest y<sup>t</sup> a capitall crime is committed, &amp; y<sup>t</sup>
        comone reporte, or probabilitie, suspition, or some complainte, (or y<sup>e</sup>
        like,) be of this or y<sup>t</sup> person, a magistrate ought to
        require, and by all due means to procure from y<sup>e</sup> person (so
        farr allready bewrayed) a naked confession of y<sup>e</sup> fact, as
        apears by y<sup>t</sup> which is morall &amp; of perpetuall equitie,
        both in y<sup>e</sup> case of uncertaine murder, Deut: 21. 1. 9. and
        slander, Deut: 22. 13. 21; for though nemo tenetur prodere seipsum, yet
        by that w<sup>ch</sup> may be known to y<sup>e</sup> magistrat by y<sup>e</sup>
        forenamed means, he is bound thus to doe, or els he may betray his
        countrie &amp; people to y<sup>e</sup> heavie displeasure of God, Levit:
        18. 24. 25. Jos: 22. 18. Psa: 106. 30; such as are in&#773;ocente to y<sup>e</sup>
        sinfull, base, cruell lusts of y<sup>e</sup> profane, &amp; such as are
        delinquents, and others with them, into y<sup>e</sup> hands of y<sup>e</sup>
        stronger temptations, &amp; more bouldness, &amp; hardnes of harte, to
        com&#773;ite more &amp; worse villany, besids all y<sup>e</sup> guilt
        &amp; hurt he will bring upon him selfe. (3<sup>ly</sup>.) To inflicte
        some punishmente meerly for this reason, to extracte a conffession of a
        capitall crime, is contrary to y<sup>e</sup> nature of vindictive
        justice, which always hath respecte to a know&#773; crime com&#773;itited
        by y<sup>e</sup> person punished; and it will therfore, for any thing
        which can before be knowne, be y<sup>e</sup> provocking and forcing of
        wrath, compared to y<sup>e</sup> wringing of y<sup>e</sup> nose, Pro:
        30. 33. which is as well forbiden y<sup>e</sup> fathers of y<sup>e</sup>
        countrie as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>of
        y<sup>e</sup> family, Ephe. 6. 4. as produsing many sad &amp; dangerous
        effects. That an oath (ex officio) for such a purpose is no due means,
        hath been abundantly proved by y<sup>e</sup> godly learned, &amp; is
        well known.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q. 3. In what cases of capitall crimes one witnes with other
        circomstances shall be sufficiente to convince? or is ther no conviction
        without 2. witneses?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ans: In taking away y<sup>e</sup> life of man, one witnes alone will not
        suffice, ther must be tow, or y<sup>t</sup> which is instar; y<sup>e</sup>
        texts are manifest, Numb: 35. 30. Deut: 17. 6. &amp; 19. 15. 2<sup>ly</sup>.
        Ther may be conviction by one witnes, &amp; some thing y<sup>t</sup>
        hath y<sup>e</sup> force of another, as y<sup>e</sup> evidencie of y<sup>e</sup>
        fact done by such an one, &amp; not an other; unforced confession when
        ther was no fear or danger of suffering for y<sup>e</sup> fact, hand
        writings acknowledged &amp; confessed.

        forbiden, Levit: 18. 22. &amp; adjudged to be punished with death,
        Levit: 20. 13. because, though ther be not penetratio corporis, yet ther

        Sodomits (who were y<sup>e</sup> first noted maisters of this unnaturall
        act of more then brutish filthines) is expressed by carnall copulation
        of man with woman: Bring them out unto us, y<sup>t</sup> we may know
        them; (2<sup>ly</sup>.) because it is observed among y<sup>e</sup>
        nations wher this unnaturall unclainnes is com&#773;ited, it is w<sup>th</sup>

        Q. How farr may a magistrat extracte a confession of a capitall crime
        from a suspected and an accused person?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ans. I conceive y<sup>t</sup> a magistrate is bound, by carfull
        examenation of circomstances &amp; waighing of probabilities, to sifte y<sup>e</sup>
        accused, and by force of argumente to draw him to an acknowledgment of y<sup>e</sup>
        truth; but he may not extracte a confession of a capitall crime from a
        suspected person by any violent means, whether it be by an oath imposed,
        or by any punishmente inflicted or threatened to be inflicted, for so he
        may draw forth an acknowledgmente of a crime from a fearfull in&#773;ocente;
        if guilty, he shall be compelled to be his owne accuser, when no other
        can, which is against y<sup>e</sup> rule of justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q. In what cases of capitall crimes one witnes with other circomstances
        shall be sufficente to convicte; or is ther no conviction without two
        witnesses?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ans: I conceive y<sup>t</sup>, in y<sup>e</sup> case of capitall crimes,
        ther can be no safe proceedings unto judgmente without too witnesses, as
        Numb: 35. 30. Deut: 19. 15. excepte ther can some evidence be prodused
        as aveilable &amp; firme to prove y<sup>e</sup> facte as a witnes is,
        then one witnes may suffice; for therin y<sup>e</sup> end and equitie of
        y<sup>e</sup> law is attained. But to proceede unto sentence of death
        upon presumptions, wher probably ther may subesse falsum, though ther be
        y<sup>e</sup> testimony of one wittnes, I supose it cannot be a safe

      <p>
        An contactus et fricatio usq&#771; ad seminis effusi&#333;nem sine
        penetratione corporis sit sodomia morte plectenda?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q. The question is what sodomiticall acts are to be punished <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>w<sup>th</sup>
        death, &amp; what very facte committed, (ipso facto,) is worthy of
        death, or if y<sup>e</sup> facte it selfe be not capitall, what
        circomstances concuring may make it capitall. The same question may be
        asked of rape, inceste, beastialitie, unnaturall sins, presumtuous sins.
        These be y<sup>e</sup> words of y<sup>e</sup> first question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ans: The answer unto this I will lay downe (as God shall directe by his
        word &amp; spirite) in these following conclusions: (1.) That y<sup>e</sup>
        judicials of Moyses, that are appendances to y<sup>e</sup> morall law,
        &amp; grounded on y<sup>e</sup> law of nature, or y<sup>e</sup>
        decalogue, are im&#773;utable, and ppetuall, w<sup>ch</sup> all orthodox
        devines acknowledge; see y<sup>e</sup> authors following. Luther, Tom.
        1. Whitenberge: fol. 435. &amp; fol. 7. Melanethon, in loc: com loco de
        conjugio. Calvin, 1. 4. Institu. c. 4. sect. 15. Junious de politia
        Moysis, thes. 29. &amp; 30. Hen: Bulin: Decad. 3. sermo. 8. Wolf: Muscu.
        loc: com: in 6. precepti explicaci: Bucer de regno Christi, 1. 2. c. 17.
        Theo: Beza, vol: 1. de hereti: puniendis, fol. 154. Zanch: in 3. pr&aelig;cept:
        Ursin: Pt. 4. explicat. contra John. Piscat: in Aphorismi Loc. de lege
        dei aphorism. 17. And more might be added. I forbear, for brevities
        sake, to set downe their very words; this being y<sup>e</sup> constante
        &amp; generall oppinion of y<sup>e</sup> best devines, I will rest in
        this as undoubtedly true, though much more might be said to confirme it.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. That all y<sup>e</sup> sin&#773;es mentioned in y<sup>e</sup>
        question were punished with death by y<sup>e</sup> judiciall law of
        Moyses, as adultry, Levit: 20. 10. Deut: 22. 22. Esech: 16. 38. Jhon. 8.
        5. which is to be understood not only of double adultrie, when as both
        parties are maried, (as some conceive,) but whosoever (besids her
        husband) lyes with a married woman, whether y<sup>e</sup> man be maried
        or not, as in y<sup>e</sup> place, Deut: 22. 22. or whosoever, being a
        maried man, lyeth with another woman (besids his wife), as P. Martire
        saith, loc: com: which in diverce respects maks y<sup>e</sup> sine worse
        on y<sup>e</sup> maried <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469"
        id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>mans parte; for y<sup>e</sup> Lord in this
        law hath respect as well to publick honesty, (the sin being so
        prejudicall to y<sup>e</sup> church &amp; state,) as y<sup>e</sup>
        private wrongs (saith Junious). So incest is to be punished with death,
        Levit: 20. 11. 22. Beastiality likwise, Lev: 20. 15. Exod: 22. 19. Raps
        in like maner, Deut: 22. 25. Sodomie in like sort, Levit: 18. 22. &amp;
        20. 13. And all presumptuous sins, Numb: 15. 30. 31.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. That y<sup>e</sup> punishmente of these foule sines w<sup>th</sup>
        death is grounded on y<sup>e</sup> law of nature, &amp; is agreeable to
        the morall law. (1.) Because y<sup>e</sup> reasons an&#773;exed shew
        them to be perpetuall. Deut. 22. 22. So shalt thou put away evill.
        Incest, beastiality, are caled confusion, &amp; wickednes. (2.) Infamie
        to y<sup>e</sup> whole humane nature, Levit: 22. 12. Levit: 18. 23. Raps
        are as murder, Deut: 22. 25. Sodomie is an abomination, Levit: 22. 22.
        [247] No holier &amp; juster laws can be devised by any man or angele
        then have been by y<sup>e</sup> Judg of all y<sup>e</sup> world, the
        wisdome of y<sup>e</sup> Father, by whom kings doe raigne, &amp;c. (3.)
        Because, before y<sup>e</sup> giving of y<sup>e</sup> Law, this
        punishmente was anciently practised, Gen: 26. 11. 38. 29. 39. 20. &amp;
        even by the heathen, by y<sup>e</sup> very light of nature, as P.
        Martire shews. (4<sup>ly</sup>.) Because y<sup>e</sup> land is defiled
        by such sins, and spews out y<sup>e</sup> inhabitants, Levit: 18. 24,
        25. &amp; that in regard of those nations y<sup>t</sup> were not
        acquainted w<sup>th</sup> the law of Moyses. 5. All y<sup>e</sup> devins
        above specified consent in this, that y<sup>e</sup> unclean acts
        punishable with death by y<sup>e</sup> law of God are not only y<sup>e</sup>
        grose acts of uncleannes by way of carnall copulation, but all y<sup>e</sup>
        evidente attempts therof, which may appeare by those severall words y<sup>t</sup>
        are used by y<sup>e</sup> spirite of God, expressing y<sup>e</sup> sins
        to be punished with death; as y<sup>e</sup> discovering of nakednes,
        Levit: 18. 20. which is retegere pudenda, as parts p<sup>r</sup>
        euphemismum (saith Junius), or detegere ad cubandum (saith Willett), to
        uncover y<sup>e</sup> shamefull parts of y<sup>e</sup> body (saith
        Ainsworth), which, though it reaches to y<sup>e</sup> grose acts, yet it
        is plaine it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>doth
        comprehend ye other foregoing immodest attempts, as contactum,
        fricationem, &amp;c.; likwise ye phrase of lying with, so often used,
        doth not only signifie carnall copulation, but other obscene acts, p<sup>r</sup>ceding
        y<sup>e</sup> same, is implyed in Pauls word [Greek: arsenokoitai], 1.
        Cor: 6. 9. &amp; men lying with men, 1. Tim: 1. 9. men defiling them
        selves w<sup>th</sup> mankind, men burning with lust towards men, Rom:
        1. 26. &amp; Levit: 18.<a name="FNanchor_EL_142" id="FNanchor_EL_142"></a><a
        href="#Footnote_EL_142" class="fnanchor">[EL]</a> 22. sodom &amp; sin
        going after strange flesh, Jud: v. 7. 8. and lying with mankind as with
        a woman, Levit: 18. 22. Abulentis says y<sup>t</sup> it signifies omnes
        modos quibus masculus masculo abutatur, changing y<sup>e</sup> naturall
        use into y<sup>t</sup> which is against nature, Rom: 1. 26. arrogare
        sibi cubare, as Junius well translats Levit: 20. 15. to give consente to
        lye withall, so approaching to a beast, &amp; lying downe therto, Levit:
        20. 16. ob solum conat&uacute;<a name="FNanchor_EM_143"
        id="FNanchor_EM_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_EM_143" class="fnanchor">[EM]</a>
        (saith Willett) or for going about to doe it. Add to this a notable
        speech of Zepperus de legibus (who hath enough to end controversies of
        this nature). L. 1. he saith: In crimine adulterii voluntas
        (understanding manifeste) sine effectu subsecuto de jure attenditur; and
        he proves it out of good laws, in these words: Solicitatores<a
        name="FNanchor_EN_144" id="FNanchor_EN_144"></a><a
        href="#Footnote_EN_144" class="fnanchor">[EN]</a> alien&#773;um nupti&#257;m
        itemq&#771; matrimon&#299;um interpellatores, etsi effectu sceleris
        potiri non possunt, propter voluntatem tamen pernicios&aelig; libidinis
        extra ordinem puniuntur; nam generale est quidem affect&#363; sine
        effectu [non] puniri, sed contrarium observatur in atrocioribus &amp;
        horum similibus.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. In concluding punishments from y<sup>e</sup> judiciall law of Moyses
        y<sup>t</sup> is perpetuall, we must often p<sup>r</sup>ceed by
        analogicall proportion &amp; interpretation, as a paribus similibus,
        minore ad majus, &amp;c.; for ther will still fall out some cases, in
        every com&#773;one-wealth, which are not in so many words extante in
        holy write, yet y<sup>e</sup> substance of y<sup>e</sup> matter in every
        kind (I conceive under correction) may be drawne and concluded out of y<sup>e</sup>
        scripture by good consequence of an equevalent <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>nature; as, for example,
        ther is no express law against destroying conception in y<sup>e</sup>
        wombe by potions, yet by anologie with Exod: 21. 22, 23. we may reason y<sup>t</sup>
        life is to be given for life. Againe, y<sup>e</sup> question, An
        contactus &amp; fricatio, &amp;c., and methinks y<sup>t</sup> place Gen:
        38. 9. in y<sup>e</sup> punishmente of Onans sin, may give some cleare
        light to it; it was (saith Pareus) beluina crudelitas quam Deus pari
        loco cum parricidio habuit, nam semen corrumpere, quid fuit aliud quam
        hominem ex semine generandum occidere? Propterea juste a Deo occisus
        est. Observe his words. And againe, Discamus quantopere Deus abominetur
        omnem seminis genitalis abusum, illicit&#257; effusionem, &amp;
        corruption&#275;, &amp;c., very pertinente to this case. That allso is
        considerable, Deut: 25. 11, 12. God comanded y<sup>t</sup>, if any wife
        drue nigh to deliver her husband out of y<sup>e</sup> hand of him y<sup>t</sup>
        smiteth him, &amp;c., her hand should be cutt off. Yet such a woman in y<sup>t</sup>
        case might say much for her selfe, y<sup>t</sup> what she did was in
        trouble &amp; perplexitie of her minde, &amp; in her husbands defence;
        yet her hand must be cutt of for such impuritie (and this is morall, as
        I conceive). Then we may reason from y<sup>e</sup> less to y<sup>e</sup>
        greater, what greevous sin in y<sup>e</sup> sight of God it is, by y<sup>e</sup>
        instigation of burning lusts, set on fire of hell, to proceede to
        contactum &amp; fricationem ad emissionem seminis, &amp;c., &amp; y<sup>t</sup>
        contra naturam, or to attempte y<sup>e</sup> grosse acts of unnaturall
        filthines. Againe, if y<sup>t</sup> unnaturall lusts of men with men, or
        woman with woman, or either with beasts, be to be punished with death,
        then a pari naturall lusts of men towards children under age are so to
        be punished.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Circumstanti&aelig; variant vis e actiunes, (saith y<sup>e</sup>
        lawiers,) &amp; circomstances in these cases cannot possibly be all reck&#275;d
        up; but God hath given laws for those causes &amp; cases that are of
        greatest momente, by which others are to be judged of, as in y<sup>e</sup>
        differance betwixte chanc medley, &amp; willfull murder; so in y<sup>e</sup>
        sins of uncleannes, it is one thing to doe <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>an acte of uncleannes by
        sudden temptation, &amp; another to lye in waite for it, yea, to make a
        com&#773;une practise of it; this mightily augments &amp; multiplies y<sup>e</sup>
        sin. Againe, some sin&#773;es of this nature are simple, others
        compound, as y<sup>t</sup> is simple adultrie, or inceste, or simple
        sodomie; but when ther is a mixture of diverce kinds of lust, as when
        adultery &amp; sodomie &amp; p&#818;<sup>r</sup>ditio seminis goe
        togeather in y<sup>e</sup> same acte of uncleannes, this is capitall,
        double, &amp; trible. Againe, when adultrie or sodomie is com&#773;ited
        by p&#818;fessors or church members, I fear it coms too near y<sup>e</sup>
        sine of y<sup>e</sup> preists daughters, forbidden, &amp; comanded to be
        punished, Levit: 21. 9. besids y<sup>e</sup> presumption of y<sup>e</sup>
        sin&#773;es of such. Againe, when uncleannes is comited with those whose
        chastity they are bound to p&#702;serve, this coms very nere the
        incestious copulation, I feare; but I must hasten to y<sup>e</sup> other
        questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        [248] 2. Question y<sup>e</sup> second, upon y<sup>e</sup> pointe of
        examination, how farr a magistrate may extracte a confession from a
        delinquente to accuse him selfe in a capitall crime, seeing Nemo tenetur
        prodere seipsum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ans: The words of y<sup>e</sup> question may be understood of extracting
        a confession from a delinquente either by oath or bodily tormente. If it
        be mente of extracting by requiring an oath, (ex officio, as some call
        it,) &amp; that in capitall crimes, I fear it is not safe, nor warented
        by Gods word, to extracte a confession from a delinquente by an oath in
        matters of life and death. (1.) Because y<sup>e</sup> practise in y<sup>e</sup>
        Scripturs is other wise, as in y<sup>e</sup> case of Achan, Jos: 7. 19.
        Give, I pray y<sup>e</sup>, glorie to y<sup>e</sup> Lord God of Israll,
        and make a confession to him, &amp; tell me how thou hast done. He did
        not compell him to sweare. So when as Johnathans life was indangered, 1.
        Sam. 14. 43. Saule said unto Johnathan, Tell me what thou hast done; he
        did not require an oath. And notable is y<sup>t</sup>, Jer: 38. 14.
        Jeremiah was charged by Zedechias, who said, I will aske the a thing,
        hide it not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>from
        me; &amp; Jeremiah said, If I declare it unto y<sup>e</sup>, wilt thou
        not surely put me to death? impling y<sup>t</sup>, in case of death, he
        would have refused to answer him. (2.) Reason shews it, &amp;
        experience; Job: 2. 4. Skin for skin, &amp;c. It is to be feared y<sup>t</sup>
        those words (whatsoever a man hath) will comprehend also y<sup>e</sup>
        conscience of an oath, and y<sup>e</sup> fear of God, and all care of
        religion; therfore for laying a snare before y<sup>e</sup> guiltie, I
        think it ought not to be donn. But now, if y<sup>e</sup> question be
        mente of inflicting bodyly torments to extracte a confession from a
        mallefactor, I conceive y<sup>t</sup> in maters of higest consequence,
        such as doe conceirne y<sup>e</sup> saftie or ruine of stats or
        countries, magistrats may proceede so farr to bodily torments, as racks,
        hote-irons, &amp;c., to extracte a conffession, espetially wher
        presumptions are strounge; but otherwise by no means. God sometims hids
        a sinner till his wickednes is filled up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Question 3. In what cases of capitall crimes, one witnes with other
        circumstances shall be sufficente to convicte, or is ther no conviction
        without 2. witneses?
      </p>
      <p>
        Deut: 19. 25. God hath given an express rule y<sup>t</sup> in no case
        one witness shall arise in judgmente, espetially not in capitall cases.
        God would not put our lives into y<sup>e</sup> power of any one toungue.
        Besids, by y<sup>e</sup> examination of more wittneses agreeing or
        disagreeing, any falshood ordenarilly may be discovered; but this is to
        be understood of one witnes of another; but if a man witnes against him
        selfe, his owne testimony is sufficente, as in y<sup>e</sup> case of y<sup>e</sup>
        Amalakite, 2. Sam: 1. 16. Againe, when ther are sure &amp; certaine
        signes &amp; evidences by circumstances, ther needs no witnes in this
        case, as in y<sup>e</sup> bussines of Adoniah desiring Abishage y<sup>e</sup>
        Shunamite to wife, that therby he might make way for him selfe unto y<sup>e</sup>
        kingdome, 1. King: 2. 23, 24. Againe, probably by many concurring
        circumstances, if probability may have y<sup>e</sup> strength of a
        witnes, somthing may be this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474"
        id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>way gathered, me thinks, from Sallomons
        judging betweexte y<sup>e</sup> true mother, and y<sup>e</sup> harlote,
        1. King. 3. 25. Lastly, I see no cause why in waighty matters, in
        defecte of witneses &amp; other proofes, we may not have recourse to a
        lott, as in y<sup>e</sup> case of Achan, Josu: 7. 16. which is a clearer
        way in such doubtfull cases (it being solemnely &amp; religiously
        performed) then any other that I know, if it be made y<sup>e</sup> last
        refuge. But all this under correction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lord in mercie directe &amp; prosper y<sup>e</sup> desires of his
        servants that desire to walk before him in truth &amp; righteousnes in
        the administration of justice, and give them wisdome and largnes of
        harte.

      Besids y<sup>e</sup> occation before mentioned in these writings
      concerning the abuse of those 2. children, they had aboute y<sup>e</sup>
      same time a case of buggerie fell out amongst them, which occasioned these
      questions, to which these answers have been made.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after y<sup>e</sup> time of y<sup>e</sup> writ&#299;g of these things
      befell a very sadd accidente of the like foule nature in this govermente,
      this very year, which I shall now relate. Ther was a youth whose name was
      Thomas Granger; he was servant to an honest man of Duxbery, being aboute
      16. or 17. years of age. (His father &amp; mother lived at the same time
      at Sityate.) He was this year detected of buggery (and indicted for y<sup>e</sup>
      same) with a mare, a cowe, tow goats, five sheep, 2. calves, and a turkey.
      Horrible [249] it is to mention, but y<sup>e</sup> truth of y<sup>e</sup>
      historie requires it. He was first discovered by one y<sup>t</sup>
      accidentally <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>saw
      his lewd practise towards the mare. (I forbear perticulers.) Being upon it
      examined and com&#773;itted, in y<sup>e</sup> end he not only confest y<sup>e</sup>
      fact with that beast at that time, but sundrie times before, and at
      severall times with all y<sup>e</sup> rest of y<sup>e</sup> forenamed in
      his indictmente; and this his free-confession was not only in private to y<sup>e</sup>
      magistrats, (though at first he strived to deney it,) but to sundrie, both
      ministers &amp; others, and afterwards, upon his indictmente, to y<sup>e</sup>
      whole court &amp; jury; and confirmed it at his execution. And wheras some
      of y<sup>e</sup> sheep could not so well be knowne by his description of
      them, others with them were brought before him, and he declared which were
      they, and which were not. And accordingly he was cast by y<sup>e</sup>
      jury, and condemned, and after executed about y<sup>e</sup> 8. of Sept<sup>r</sup>,
      1642. A very sade spectakle it was; for first the mare, and then y<sup>e</sup>
      cowe, and y<sup>e</sup> rest of y<sup>e</sup> lesser catle, were kild
      before his face, according to y<sup>e</sup> law, Levit: 20. 15. and then
      he him selfe was executed. The catle were all cast into a great &amp;
      large pitte that was digged of purposs for them, and no use made of any
      part of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon y<sup>e</sup> examenation of this person, and also of a former that
      had made some sodomiticall attempts upon another, it being demanded of
      them how they came first to y<sup>e</sup> knowledge and practice of such
      wickednes, the one confessed he had long used it in old England; and this
      youth last spoaken of said he was taught it <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>by an other that had heard
      of such things from some in England when he was ther, and they kept catle
      togeather. By which it appears how one wicked person may infecte many; and
      what care all ought to have what servants they bring into their families.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it may be demanded how came it to pass that so many wicked persons and
      profane people should so quickly come over into this land, &amp; mixe them
      selves amongst them? seeing it was religious men y<sup>t</sup> begane y<sup>e</sup>
      work, and they came for religions sake. I confess this may be marveilled
      at, at least in time to come, when the reasons therof should not be
      knowne; and y<sup>e</sup> more because here was so many hardships and
      wants mett withall. I shall therfore indeavor to give some answer
      hereunto. And first, according to y<sup>t</sup> in y<sup>e</sup> gospell,
      it is ever to be remembred that wher y<sup>e</sup> Lord begins to sow good
      seed, ther y<sup>e</sup> envious man will endeavore to sow tares. 2. Men
      being to come over into a wildernes, in which much labour &amp; servise
      was to be done aboute building &amp; planting, &amp;c., such as wanted
      help in y<sup>t</sup> respecte, when they could not have such as y<sup>ey</sup>
      would, were glad to take such as they could; and so, many untoward
      servants, sundry of them proved, that were thus brought over, both men
      &amp; women kind: who, when their times were expired, became families of
      them selves, which gave increase hereunto. 3. An other and a maine reason
      hearof was, that men, finding <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477"
      id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>so many godly disposed persons willing to
      come into these parts, some begane to make a trade of it, to transeport
      passengers &amp; their goods, and hired ships for that end; and then, to
      make up their fraight and advance their profite, cared not who y<sup>e</sup>
      persons were, so they had money to pay them. And by this means the cuntrie
      became pestered with many unworthy persons, who, being come over, crept
      into one place or other. 4. Againe, the Lords blesing usually following
      his people, as well in outward as spirituall things, (though afflictions
      be mixed withall,) doe make many to adhear to y<sup>e</sup> people of God,
      as many followed Christ, for y<sup>e</sup> loaves sake, John 6. 26. and a
      mixed multitud came into y<sup>e</sup> willdernes with y<sup>e</sup>
      people of God out of Eagipte of old, Exod. 12. 38; so allso ther were
      sente by their freinds some under hope y<sup>t</sup> they would be made
      better; others that they might be eased of such burthens, and they kept
      from shame at home y<sup>t</sup> would necessarily follow their dissolute
      courses. And thus, by one means or other, in 20. years time, it is a
      question whether y<sup>e</sup> greater part be not growne y<sup>e</sup>
      worser.

        deeply ingaged your selfe, for which complements &amp; words are no
        reall satisfaction, &amp;c. For y<sup>e</sup> agreemente you have made
        with M<sup>r</sup>. Bradford, M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow, &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
        rest of y<sup>e</sup> partners ther, considering how honestly and justly
        I am perswaded they have brought in an accounte of y<sup>e</sup>

        lovingly and freindly, and to pass by all failings of all, the conclude
        is accepted of; I say this agreemente y<sup>t</sup> you have made is
        condesended unto, and M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews hath sent his release to M<sup>r</sup>.
        Winthrop, with such directions as he conceives fitt; and I have made

        tedious &amp; troublsome bussines, &amp; I thinke I may truly say
        uncomfurtable &amp; unprofitable to all, &amp;c. It hath pleased God now
        to put us upon a way to sease all suits, and disquieting of our
        spirites, and to conclude with peace and love, as we began. I am
        contented to yeeld &amp; make good what M<sup>r</sup>. Attwood and you
        have agreed upon; and for y<sup>t</sup> end have sente to my loving
        friend, M<sup>r</sup>. Attwood, an absolute and generall release unto

        selves, &amp; it shall be done, provided y<sup>t</sup> all you, either
        joyntly or severally, seale y<sup>e</sup> like discharge to me. And for
        y<sup>t</sup> end I have drawne one joyntly, and sent it to M<sup>r</sup>.
        Attwood, with y<sup>t</sup> I have sealed to you. Mr. Andrews hath
        sealed an aquitance also, &amp; sent it to M<sup>r</sup>. Winthrop,
        whith such directions as he conceived fitt, and, as I hear, hath given
        his debte, which he maks 544<sup>li</sup>. unto y<sup>e</sup> gentlemen

        with M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews, M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp, &amp; my selfe, to
        bring us to agree, and to y<sup>t</sup> end we have had many meetings
        and spent much time aboute it. But as they are very religious &amp;
        honest gentle-men, yet they had an end y<sup>t</sup> they drove at &amp;
        laboured to accomplish (I meane not any private end, but for y<sup>e</sup>
        generall good of their patente). It had been very well you had sent one
        over. M<sup>r</sup>. Andrew wished you might have one 3. parte of y<sup>e</sup>
        1200<sup>li</sup>. &amp; the Bay 2. thirds; but then we 3. must have
        agreed togeather, which were a hard mater now. But M<sup>r</sup>. Weld,
        M<sup>r</sup>. Peters, &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Hibbens, &amp; I, have
        agreed, they giving you bond (so to compose with M<sup>r</sup>.
        Beachamp, as) to procure his generall release, &amp; free you from all
        trouble &amp; charge y<sup>t</sup> he may put you too; which indeed is
        nothing, for I am perswaded M<sup>r</sup>. Weld will in time gaine him
        to give them all that is dew to [251] him, which in some sorte is
        granted allready; for though his demands be great, yet M<sup>r</sup>.
        Andrewes hath taken some paines in it, and makes it appear to be less
        then I thinke he will consente to give them for so good an <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>use; so
        you neede not fear, that for taking bond ther to save you harmles, you
        be safe and well. Now our accord is, y<sup>t</sup> you must pay to y<sup>e</sup>
        gentle-men of y<sup>e</sup> Bay 900<sup>li</sup>.; they are to bear all
        chargs y<sup>t</sup> may any way arise concerning y<sup>e</sup> free

      </p>
      <p>
        Upon y<sup>e</sup> receiving of my release from you, I will send you
        your bonds for y<sup>e</sup> purchass money. I would have sent them now,
        but I would have M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp release as well as I, because
        you are bound to him in them. Now I know if a man be bound to 12. men,
        if one release, it is as if all released, and my discharge doth cutt
        them of; wherfore doubte you not but you shall have them, &amp; your

        years of y<sup>e</sup> purchass money, that I would not owne, for I have

      M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews his discharg was to y<sup>e</sup> same effecte; he
      was by agreem&#275;te to have 500<sup>li</sup>. of y<sup>e</sup> money,
      the which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>he
      gave to them in y<sup>e</sup> Bay, who brought his discharge and demanded
      y<sup>e</sup> money. And they tooke in his release and paid y<sup>e</sup>
      money according to agreem&#275;te, viz. one third of the 500<sup>li</sup>.
      they paid downe in hand, and y<sup>e</sup> rest in 4. equall payments, to
      be paid yearly, for which they gave their bonds. And wheras 44<sup>li</sup>.
      was more demanded, they conceived they could take it of with M<sup>r</sup>.
      Andrews, and therfore it was not in the bonde. [252] But M<sup>r</sup>.
      Beachamp would not parte with any of his, but demanded 400<sup>li</sup>.
      of y<sup>e</sup> partners here, &amp; sent a release to a friend, to
      deliver it to them upon y<sup>e</sup> receite of y<sup>e</sup> money. But
      his relese was not perfecte, for he had left out some of y<sup>e</sup>
      partners names, with some other defects; and besids, the other gave them
      to understand he had not near so much due. So no end was made with him
      till 4. years after; of which in it plase. And in y<sup>t</sup> regard,
      that them selves did not agree, I shall inserte some part of M<sup>r</sup>.
      Andrews letter, by which he conceives y<sup>e</sup> partners here were
      wronged, as followeth. This leter of his was write to M<sup>r</sup>.
      Edmond Freeman, brother in law to M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp.

        M<sup>r</sup>. Freeman,
      </p>
      <p>
        My love remembred unto you, &amp;c. I then certified y<sup>e</sup>
        partners how I found M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp &amp; M<sup>r</sup>.
        Sherley, in their perticuler demands, which was according to mens
        principles, of getting what they could; allthough y<sup>e</sup> one will
        not shew any accounte, and y<sup>e</sup> other a very unfaire and unjust
        one; and both of them discouraged me from sending y<sup>e</sup> partners
        my accounte, M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp espetially. Their reason, I have
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>cause
        to conceive, was, y<sup>t</sup> allthough I doe not, nor ever intended
        to, wrong y<sup>e</sup> partners or y<sup>e</sup> bussines, yet, if I
        gave no accounte, I might be esteemed as guiltie as they, in some degree
        at least; and they might seeme to be y<sup>e</sup> more free from
        taxation in not delivering their accounts, who have both of them charged
        y<sup>e</sup> accounte with much intrest they have payed forth, and one
        of them would likwise for much intrest he hath not paid forth, as
        appeareth by his accounte, &amp;c. And seeing y<sup>e</sup> partners
        have now made it appear y<sup>t</sup> ther is 1200<sup>li</sup>.
        remaining due between us all, and that it may appear by my accounte I
        have not charged y<sup>e</sup> bussines with any intrest, but doe
        forgive it unto y<sup>e</sup> partners, above 200<sup>li</sup>. if M<sup>r</sup>.
        Sherley &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp, who have betweene them wronged y<sup>e</sup>
        bussines so many 100<sup>li</sup>. both in principall &amp; intrest
        likwise, and have therin wronged me as well and as much as any of y<sup>e</sup>
        partners; yet if they will not make &amp; deliver faire &amp; true
        accounts of y<sup>e</sup> same, nor be contente to take what by
        computation is more then can be justly due to either, that is, to M<sup>r</sup>.
        Beachamp 150<sup>li</sup>. as by M<sup>r</sup>. Allertons accounte, and
        M<sup>r</sup>. Sherleys accounte, on oath in chancerie; and though ther
        might be nothing due to M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley, yet he requirs 100<sup>li</sup>.
        &amp;c. I conceive, seing y<sup>e</sup> partners have delivered on their
        oaths y<sup>e</sup> sum&#773;e remaining in their hands, that they may
        justly detaine y<sup>e</sup> 650<sup>li</sup>. which may remaine in
        their hands, after I am satisfied, untill M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley &amp; M<sup>r</sup>.
        Beachamp will be more fair &amp; just in their ending, &amp;c. And as I
        intend, if y<sup>e</sup> partners fayrly end with me, in satisfing in
        parte and ingaging them selves for y<sup>e</sup> rest of my said 544<sup>li</sup>.
        to returne back for y<sup>e</sup> poore my parte of y<sup>e</sup> land
        at Sityate, so likwise I intend to relinquish my right &amp; intrest in
        their dear patente, on which much of our money was laid forth, and also
        my right &amp; intrest in their cheap purchass, the which may have cost
        me first &amp; last 350<sup>li</sup>.<a name="FNanchor_EO_145"
        id="FNanchor_EO_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_EO_145" class="fnanchor">[EO]</a>
        But I doubte whether other men have not <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>charged or taken on
        accounte what they have disbursed in y<sup>e</sup> like case, which I
        have not charged, neither did I conceive any other durst so doe, untill
        I saw y<sup>e</sup> accounte of the one and heard y<sup>e</sup> words of
        y<sup>e</sup> other; the which gives me just cause to suspecte both
        their accounts to be unfaire; for it seemeth they consulted one with
        another aboute some perticulers therin. Therfore I conceive y<sup>e</sup>
        partners ought y<sup>e</sup> rather to require just accounts from each
        of them before they parte with any money to either of them. For
        marchants understand how to give an acounte; if they mean fairley, they
        will not deney to give an accounte, for they keep memorialls to helpe
        them to give exacte acounts in all perticulers, and memoriall cannot
        forget his charge, if y<sup>e</sup> man will remember. I desire not to
        wrong M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp or M<sup>r</sup>. Sherley, nor may be
        silente in such apparente probabilities of their wronging y<sup>e</sup>
        partners, and me likwise, either in deneying to deliver or shew any
        accounte, or in delivering one very unjuste in some perticulers, and
        very suspitious in many more; either of which, being from understanding
        marchants, cannot be from weaknes or simplisitie, and therfore y<sup>e</sup>
        more unfaire. So comending you &amp; yours, and all y<sup>e</sup> Lord's
        people, unto y<sup>e</sup> gratious protection and blessing of y<sup>e</sup>
        Lord, and rest your loving friend,

        all, hoping it will be a good conclude of a generall, but a costly &amp;
        tedious bussines I thinke to all, I am sure to me, &amp;c.
      </p>
      <p>
        I received from M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow a letter of y<sup>e</sup> 28. of
        Sept: last, and so much as concernes y<sup>e</sup> generall bussines I
        shall answer in this, not knowing whether I shall have opportunitie to
        write perticuler letters, &amp;c. I expected more letters from you all,
        as some perticuler writs,<a name="FNanchor_EQ_147" id="FNanchor_EQ_147"></a><a
        href="#Footnote_EQ_147" class="fnanchor">[EQ]</a> but it seemeth no fitt
        opportunity was offered. And now, though y<sup>e</sup> bussines for y<sup>e</sup>
        maine may stand, yet some perticulers is alltered; I say my former
        agreemente with M<sup>r</sup>. Weld &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Peters, before
        they<a name="FNanchor_ER_148" id="FNanchor_ER_148"></a><a
        href="#Footnote_ER_148" class="fnanchor">[ER]</a> could conclude or gett
        any grante of M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews, they sought to have my release;
        and ther upon they sealed me a bond for a 110<sup>li</sup>. So I sente
        my acquittance, for they said without mine ther would be no end made (&amp;
        ther was good reason for it). Now they hoped, if y<sup>ey</sup> ended
        with me, to gaine M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews parte, as they did holy, to a
        pound, (at which I should wonder, but y<sup>t</sup> I observe some
        passages,) and they also hoped to have gotten M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamps
        part, &amp; I did thinke he would have given it them. But if he did well
        understand him selfe, &amp; that acounte, he would give it; for his
        demands make a great sound.<a name="FNanchor_ES_149" id="FNanchor_ES_149"></a><a
        href="#Footnote_ES_149" class="fnanchor">[ES]</a> But it seemeth he
        would not parte with it, supposing it too great a sume, and y<sup>t</sup>
        he might easily gaine it from you. Once he would have given them 40<sup>li</sup>.
        but now they say he will not doe that, or rather I suppose they will not
        take it; for if they doe, &amp; have M<sup>r</sup>. Andrewses, then they
        must pay me their bond of 110<sup>li</sup>. 3 months hence. Now it will
        fall out farr better for you, y<sup>t</sup> they deal not with Mr.
        Beachamp, and also for me, if you <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>be as kind to me as I have
        been &amp; will be to you; and y<sup>t</sup> thus, if you pay M<sup>r</sup>.
        Andrews, or y<sup>e</sup> Bay men, by his order, 544<sup>li</sup>. which
        is his full demande; but if looked into, perhaps might be less. The man
        is honest, &amp; in my conscience would not wittingly doe wronge, yett
        he may forgett as well as other men; and M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow may call
        to minde wherin he forgetts; (but some times it is good to buy peace.)
        The gentlemen of y<sup>e</sup> Bay may abate 100<sup>li</sup>. and so
        both sids have more right &amp; justice then if they exacte all, &amp;c.
        Now if you send me a 150<sup>li</sup>. then say M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews
        full sume, &amp; this, it is nere 700<sup>li</sup>. M<sup>r</sup>.
        Beachamp he demands 400<sup>li</sup>. and we all know that, if a man
        demands money, he must shew wherfore, and make proofe of his debte;
        which I know he can never make good proafe of one hunderd pound dew unto
        him as principall money; so till he can, you have good reason to keep y<sup>e</sup>
        500<sup>li</sup>. &amp;c. This I proteste I write not in malice against
        M<sup>r</sup>. Beachamp, for it is a reall truth. You may partly see it
        by M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews making up his accounte, and I think you are
        all perswaded I can say more then M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews concerning that
        accounte. I wish I could make up my owne as plaine &amp; easily, but
        because of former discontents, I will be sparing till I be called; &amp;
        you may injoye y<sup>e</sup> 500<sup>li</sup>. quietly till he begine;
        for let him take his course hear or ther, it shall be all one, I will
        doe him no wronge; and if he have not on peney more, he is less loser
        then either M<sup>r</sup>. Andrews or I. This I conceive to be just
        &amp; honest; y<sup>e</sup> having or not having of his release matters
        not; let him make such proafe of his debte as you cannot disprove, and
        according to your first agreemente you will pay it, &amp;c.

      I am to begine this year whith that which was a mater of great saddnes and
      mo&#363;ring unto them all. Aboute y<sup>e</sup> 18. of Aprill dyed their
      Reve<sup>d</sup> Elder, and my dear &amp; loving friend, M<sup>r</sup>.
      William Brewster; a man that had done and suffered much for y<sup>e</sup>
      Lord Jesus and y<sup>e</sup> gospells sake, and had bore his parte in well
      and woe with this poore persecuted church above 36. years [254] in
      England, Holand, and in this wildernes, and done y<sup>e</sup> Lord &amp;
      them faithfull service in his place &amp; calling. And notwithstanding y<sup>e</sup>
      many troubls and sorrows he passed throw, the Lord upheld him to a great
      age. He was nere fourskore years of age (if not all out) when he dyed. He
      had this blesing added by y<sup>e</sup> Lord to all y<sup>e</sup> rest, to
      dye in his bed, in peace, amongst y<sup>e</sup> mids of his freinds, who
      mourned &amp; wepte over him, and ministered what help &amp; comforte they
      could unto him, and he againe recomforted them whilst he could. His
      sicknes was not long, and till y<sup>e</sup> last day therof he did not
      wholy keepe his bed. His speech continued till somewhat more then halfe a
      day, &amp; then failed him; and aboute 9. or 10. a clock that ev&#299;ng
      he dyed, without any pangs at all. A few howers before, he drew his breath
      shorte, and some few minuts before his last, he drew his breath long, as a
      man falen into a sound slepe, without any pangs or gaspings, and so
      sweetly departed this life unto a better.

      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      I would now demand of any, what he was y<sup>e</sup> worse for any former
      sufferings? What doe I say, worse? Nay, sure he was y<sup>e</sup> better,
      and they now added to his honour. <i>It is a manifest token</i> (saith y<sup>e</sup>
      Apostle, 2. Thes: 1. 5, 6, 7.) <i>of y<sup>e</sup> righeous judgmente of
      God that you may be counted worthy of y<sup>e</sup> kingdome of God, for
      which ye allso suffer; seing it is a righteous thing with God to
      recompence tribulation to them y<sup>t</sup> trouble you: and to you who
      are troubled, rest with us, when y<sup>e</sup> Lord Jesus shall be
      revealed from heaven, with his mighty angels.</i> 1. Pet. 4. 14. <i>If you
      be reproached for y<sup>e</sup> name of Christ, hapy are ye, for y<sup>e</sup>
      spirite of glory and of God resteth upon you.</i> What though he wanted y<sup>e</sup>
      riches and pleasurs of y<sup>e</sup> world in this life, and pompous
      monuments at his funurall? yet y<sup>e</sup> memoriall of y<sup>e</sup>
      just shall be blessed, when y<sup>e</sup> name of y<sup>e</sup> wicked
      shall rott (with their marble monuments). Pro: 10. 7.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should say something of his life, if to say a litle were not worse then
      to be silent. But I cannot wholy forbear, though hapily more may be done
      hereafter. After he had attained some learning, viz. y<sup>e</sup>
      knowledg of y<sup>e</sup> Latine tongue, &amp; some insight in y<sup>e</sup>
      Greeke, and spent some small time at Cambridge, and then being first
      seasoned with y<sup>e</sup> seeds of grace and vertue, he went to y<sup>e</sup>
      Courte, and served that religious and godly gentlman, M<sup>r</sup>.
      Davison, diverce years, when he was Secretary of State; who found him so
      discreete and faithfull <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489"
      id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>as he trusted him above all other that were
      aboute him, and only imployed him in all matters of greatest trust and
      secrecie. He esteemed him rather as a sonne then a servante, and for his
      wisdom &amp; godlines (in private) he would converse with him more like a
      freind &amp; familier then a maister. He attended his m<sup>r</sup>. when
      he was sente in ambassage by the Queene into y<sup>e</sup> Low-Countries,
      in y<sup>e</sup> Earle of Leicesters time, as for other waighty affaires
      of state, so to receive possession of the cautionary townes, and in token
      &amp; signe therof the keyes of Flushing being delivered to him, in her ma<sup>tis</sup>
      name, he kepte them some time, and com&#773;itted them to this his
      servante, who kept them under his pilow, on which he slepte y<sup>e</sup>
      first night. And, at his returne, y<sup>e</sup> States honoured him with a
      gould chaine, and his maister com&#773;itted it to him, and com&#773;anded
      him to wear it when they arrived in England, as they ridd thorrow the
      country, till they came to y<sup>e</sup> Courte. He afterwards remained
      with him till his troubles, that he was put from his place aboute y<sup>e</sup>
      death of y<sup>e</sup> Queene of Scots; and some good time after, doeing
      him manie faithfull offices of servise in y<sup>e</sup> time of his
      troubles. Afterwards he wente and lived in y<sup>e</sup> country, in good
      esteeme amongst his freinds and y<sup>e</sup> gentle-men of those parts,
      espetially the godly &amp; religious. He did much good in y<sup>e</sup>
      countrie wher he lived, in promoting and furthering religion, not only by
      his practiss &amp; example, and provocking and incouraging of others, but
      by procuring <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>of
      good preachers to y<sup>e</sup> places theraboute, and, drawing on of
      others to assiste &amp; help forward in such a worke; he him selfe most
      comonly deepest in y<sup>e</sup> charge, &amp; some times above his
      abillitie. And in this state he continued many years, doeing y<sup>e</sup>
      best good he could, and walking according to y<sup>e</sup> light he saw,
      till y<sup>e</sup> Lord reveiled further unto him. And in y<sup>e</sup>
      end, by y<sup>e</sup> tirrany of y<sup>e</sup> bishops against godly
      preachers &amp; people, in silenceing the one &amp; persecuting y<sup>e</sup>
      other, he and many more of those times begane to looke further into
      things, and to see into y<sup>e</sup> unlawfullnes of their callings, and
      y<sup>e</sup> burthen of many anti-christian corruptions, which both he
      and they endeavored to cast of; as y<sup>ey</sup> allso did, as in y<sup>e</sup>
      begining of this treatis is to be seene. [255] After they were joyned
      togither in comunion, he was a spetiall stay &amp; help unto them. They
      ordinarily mett at his house on y<sup>e</sup> Lords day, (which was a
      manor of y<sup>e</sup> bishops,) and with great love he entertained them
      when they came, making provission for them to his great charge. He was y<sup>e</sup>
      cheefe of those that were taken at Boston, and suffered y<sup>e</sup>
      greatest loss; and of y<sup>e</sup> seven that were kept longst in prison,
      and after bound over to y<sup>e</sup> assises. Affter he came into Holland
      he suffered much hardship, after he had spente y<sup>e</sup> most of his
      means, haveing a great charge, and many children; and, in regard of his
      former breeding &amp; course of life, not so fitt for many imployments as
      others were, espetially such as were toylesume &amp; <span class="pagenum"><a

      bore his condition with much cherfullnes and contentation. Towards y<sup>e</sup>
      later parte of those 12. years spente in Holland, his outward condition
      was mended, and he lived well &amp; plentifully; for he fell into a way
      (by reason he had y<sup>e</sup> Latine tongue) to teach many students, who
      had a disire to lerne y<sup>e</sup> English tongue, to teach them English;
      and by his method they quickly attained it with great facilitie; for he
      drew rules to lerne it by, after y<sup>e</sup> Latine maner; and many
      gentlemen, both Danes &amp; Germans, resorted to him, as they had time
      from other studies, some of them being great mens son&#773;es. He also had
      means to set up printing, (by y<sup>e</sup> help of some freinds,) and so
      had imploymente inoughg, and by reason of many books which would not be
      alowed to be printed in England, they might have had more then they could
      doe. But now removeing into this countrie, all these things were laid
      aside againe, and a new course of living must be framed unto; in which he
      was no way unwilling to take his parte, and to bear his burthen with y<sup>e</sup>
      rest, living many times without bread, or corne, many months together,
      having many times nothing but fish, and often wanting that also; and
      drunke nothing but water for many years togeather, yea, till within 5. or
      6. years of his death. And yet he lived (by y<sup>e</sup> blessing of God)
      in health till very old age. And besids y<sup>t</sup>, he would labour
      with his hands in y<sup>e</sup> feilds as long as he was able; yet when
      the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>church
      had no other minister, he taught twise every Saboth, and y<sup>t</sup>
      both powerfully and profitably, to y<sup>e</sup> great contentment of y<sup>e</sup>
      hearers, and their comfortable edification; yea, many were brought to God
      by his ministrie. He did more in this behalfe in a year, then many that
      have their hundreds a year doe in all their lives. For his personall
      abilities, he was qualified above many; he was wise and discreete and well
      spoken, having a grave &amp; deliberate utterance, of a very cherfull
      spirite, very sociable &amp; pleasante amongst his freinds, of an humble
      and modest mind, of a peaceable disposition, under vallewing him self
      &amp; his owne abilities, and some time over valewing others; inoffencive
      and in&#773;ocente in his life &amp; conversation, w<sup>ch</sup> gained
      him y<sup>e</sup> love of those without, as well as those within; yet he
      would tell them plainely of their faults &amp; evills, both publickly
      &amp; privatly, but in such a maner as usually was well taken from him. He
      was tender harted, and compassionate of such as were in miserie, but
      espetialy of such as had been of good estate and ranke, and were fallen
      unto want &amp; poverty, either for goodnes &amp; religions sake, or by y<sup>e</sup>
      injury &amp; oppression of others; he would say, of all men these deserved
      to be pitied most. And none did more offend &amp; displease him then such
      as would hautily and proudly carry &amp; lift up themselves, being rise
      from nothing, and haveing litle els in them to comend them but a few fine
      cloaths, or a litle riches more then others. In <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>teaching, he was very moving
      &amp; stirring of affections, also very plaine &amp; distincte in what he
      taught; by which means he became y<sup>e</sup> more profitable to y<sup>e</sup>
      hearers. He had a singuler good gift in prayer, both publick &amp;
      private, in ripping up y<sup>e</sup> hart &amp; conscience before God, in
      the humble confession of sinne, and begging y<sup>e</sup> mercies of God
      in Christ for y<sup>e</sup> pardon of y<sup>e</sup> same. He always
      thought it were better for ministers to pray oftener, and devide their
      prears, then be longe &amp; tedious in the same (excepte upon sollemne
      &amp; spetiall occations, as in days of humiliation &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
      like). His reason was, that y<sup>e</sup> harte &amp; spirits of all,
      espetialy y<sup>e</sup> weake, could hardly continue &amp; stand bente (as
      it were) so long towards God, as they ought to doe in y<sup>t</sup> duty,
      without flagging and falling of. For y<sup>e</sup> govermente of y<sup>e</sup>
      church, (which was most [256] proper to his office,) he was carfull to
      preserve good order in y<sup>e</sup> same, and to preserve puritie, both
      in y<sup>e</sup> doctrine &amp; comunion of y<sup>e</sup> same; and to
      supress any errour or contention that might begine to rise up amongst
      them; and accordingly God gave good success to his indeavors herein all
      his days, and he saw y<sup>e</sup> fruite of his labours in that behalfe.
      But I must breake of, having only thus touched a few, as it were, heads of
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot but here take occasion, not only to mention, but greatly to
      admire y<sup>e</sup> marvelous providence of God, that notwithstanding y<sup>e</sup>
      many changes and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>hardships
      that these people wente throwgh, and y<sup>e</sup> many enemies they had
      and difficulties they mette with all, that so many of them should live to
      very olde age! It was not only this reve<sup>d</sup> mans condition, (for
      one swallow maks no summer, as they say,) but many more of them did y<sup>e</sup>
      like, some dying aboute and before this time, and many still living, who
      attained to 60. years of age, and to 65. diverse to 70. and above, and
      some nere 80. as he did. It must needs be more then ordinarie, and above
      naturall reason, that so it should be; for it is found in experience, that
      chaing of aeir, famine, or unholsome foode, much drinking of water,
      sorrows &amp; troubls, &amp;c., all of them are enimies to health, causes
      of many diseaces, consumers of naturall vigoure and y<sup>e</sup> bodys of
      men, and shortners of life. And yet of all these things they had a large
      parte, and suffered deeply in y<sup>e</sup> same. They wente from England
      to Holand, wher they found both worse air and dyet then that they came
      from; from thence (induring a long imprisonmente, as it were, in y<sup>e</sup>
      ships at sea) into New-England; and how it hath been with them hear hath
      allready beene showne; and what crosses, troubls, fears, wants, and
      sorrowes they had been lyable unto, is easie to conjecture; so as in some
      sorte they may say with y<sup>e</sup> Apostle, 2. Cor: 11. 26, 27. they
      were <i>in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perills of robers,
      in perills of their owne nation, in perils among y<sup>e</sup> heathen, in
      perills in y<sup>e</sup> willdernes, in perills in y<sup>e</sup> sea,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>in
      perills among false breethern; in wearines &amp; painfullnes, in watching
      often, in hunger and thirst, in fasting often, in could and nakednes.</i>
      What was it then that upheld them? It was Gods vissitation that preserved
      their spirits. Job 10. 12. <i>Thou hast given me life and grace, and thy
      vissitation hath preserved my spirite.</i> He that upheld y<sup>e</sup>
      Apostle upheld them. <i>They were persecuted, but not forsaken, cast
      downe, but perished not.</i> 2. Cor: 4. 9. <i>As unknowen, and yet knowen;
      as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and yett not kiled.</i> 2.
      Cor: 6. 9. God, it seems, would have all men to behold and observe such
      mercies and works of his providence as these are towards his people, that
      they in like cases might be incouraged to depend upon God in their trials,
      &amp; also blese his name when they see his goodnes towards others. Man
      lives not by bread only, Deut: 8. 3. It is not by good &amp; dainty fare,
      by peace, &amp; rest, and harts ease, in injoying y<sup>e</sup>
      contentments and good things of this world only, that preserves health and
      prolongs life. God in such examples would have y<sup>e</sup> world see
      &amp; behold that he can doe it without them; and if y<sup>e</sup> world
      will shut ther eyes, and take no notice therof, yet he would have his
      people to see and consider it. Daniell could be better liking with pulse
      then others were with y<sup>e</sup> kings dainties. Jaacob, though he
      wente from one nation to another people, and passed thorow famine, fears,
      &amp; many afflictions, yet he lived till old age, and <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>dyed
      sweetly, &amp; rested in y<sup>e</sup> Lord, as infinite others of Gods
      servants have done, and still shall doe, (through Gods goodnes,)
      notwithstanding all y<sup>e</sup> malice of their enemies; <i>when y<sup>e</sup>
      branch of y<sup>e</sup> wicked shall be cut of before his day</i>, Job.
      15. 32. <i>and the bloody and deceitfull men shall not live out halfe
      their days</i>. Psa: 55. 23.

      By reason of y<sup>e</sup> plottings of the Narigansets, (ever since y<sup>e</sup>

        Massachusets shall be for ever under y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, and

        confederation, in differente proportions, according to their differente
        abillities, in maner following: namely, y<sup>t</sup> the comissioners

        bring a true accounte and number of all their males in every plantation,
        or any way belonging too or under their severall jurisdictions, of what
        qualitie or condition soever they be, from 16. years old to 60, being

        jurisdiction upon a true &amp; just accounte, the service of men and all
        charges of y<sup>e</sup> warr be borne by y<sup>e</sup> pole; each
        jurisdiction or plantation being left to their owne just course &amp;
        custome of rating them selves and people according to their differente

        priviledg. And y<sup>t</sup> according to their differente charge of
        each jurisdiction &amp; plantation, the whole advantage of y<sup>e</sup>

      <p>
        5. It is further agreed, that if these jurisdictions, or any plantation

        upon notice &amp; requeste of any 3. [258] magistrats of y<sup>t</sup>
        jurisdiction so invaded, y<sup>e</sup> rest of y<sup>e</sup>
        confederats, without any further meeting or expostulation, shall
        forthwith send ayde to y<sup>e</sup> confederate in danger, but in
        differente proportion; namely, y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets an hundred men
        sufficently armed &amp; provided for such a service and journey, and
        each of y<sup>e</sup> rest forty five so armed &amp; provided, or any
        lesser number, if less be required according to this proportion. But if
        such confederate in danger may be supplyed by their nexte confederates,
        not exeeding y<sup>e</sup> number hereby agreed, they may crave help
        ther, and seeke no further for y<sup>e</sup> presente; y<sup>e</sup>

        returne to be victuled &amp; suplyed with powder &amp; shote for their
        jurney (if ther be need) by y<sup>t</sup> jurisdiction which imployed or
        sent for them. But none of y<sup>e</sup> jurisdictions to exceede these
        numbers till, by a meeting of y<sup>e</sup> com&#773;issioners for this
        confederation, a greater aide appear nessessarie. And this proportion to
        continue till upon knowlege of greater numbers in each jurisdiction,
        which shall be brought to y<sup>e</sup> nexte meeting, some other
        proportion be ordered. But in such case of sending men for presente
        aide, whether before or after such order or alteration, it is agreed y<sup>t</sup>
        at y<sup>e</sup> meeting of y<sup>e</sup> comissioners for this
        confederation, the cause of such warr or invasion be duly considered;
        and if it appeare y<sup>t</sup> the falte lay in y<sup>e</sup> parties
        so invaded, y<sup>t</sup> then that jurisdiction or plantation make just
        satisfaction both to y<sup>e</sup> invaders whom they have injured, and
        beare all y<sup>e</sup> charges of y<sup>e</sup> warr them selves,
        without requiring any allowance from y<sup>e</sup> rest of y<sup>e</sup>
        confederats towards y<sup>e</sup> same. And further, y<sup>t</sup> if
        any jurisdiction see any danger of any invasion <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>approaching, and ther be
        time for a meeting, that in such a case 3. magistrats of y<sup>t</sup>
        jurisdiction may sum&#773;one a meeting, at such conveniente place as
        them selves shall thinke meete, to consider &amp; provid against y<sup>e</sup>
        threatened danger, provided when they are mett, they may remove to what
        place they please; only, whilst any of these foure confederats have but
        3 magistrats in their jurisdiction, their requeste, or summons, from any
        2. of them shall be accounted of equall force with y<sup>e</sup> 3.
        mentioned in both the clauses of this article, till ther be an increase
        of majestrats ther.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. It is also agreed y<sup>t</sup>, for y<sup>e</sup> managing &amp;
        concluding of all affairs propper, &amp; concerning the whole
        confederation, tow comissioners shall be chosen by &amp; out of each of
        these 4. jurisdictions; namly, 2. for y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, 2. for
        Plimoth, 2. for Conightecutt, and 2. for New-Haven, being all in church
        fellowship with us, which shall bring full power from their severall
        Generall Courts respectively to hear, examene, waigh, and detirmine all
        affairs of warr, or peace, leagues, aids, charges, and numbers of men
        for warr, divissions of spoyles, &amp; whatsoever is gotten by conquest;
        receiving of more confederats, or plantations into combination with any
        of y<sup>e</sup> confederates, and all things of like nature, which are
        y<sup>e</sup> proper concomitants or consequences of such a
        confederation, for amitie, offence, &amp; defence; not inter-medling
        with y<sup>e</sup> govermente of any of y<sup>e</sup> jurisdictions,
        which by y<sup>e</sup> 3. article is preserved entirely to them selves.
        But if these 8. comissioners when they meete shall not all agree, yet it
        concluded that any 6. of the 8. agreeing shall have power to setle &amp;
        determine y<sup>e</sup> bussines in question. But if 6. doe not agree,
        that then such propositions, with their reasons, so farr as they have
        been debated, be sente, and referred to y<sup>e</sup> 4. Generall
        Courts, viz. y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, Plimoth, Conightecutt, and
        New-haven; and if at all y<sup>e</sup> said Generall Courts y<sup>e</sup>
        bussines so referred be concluded, <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>then to be prosecuted by y<sup>e</sup>
        confederats, and all their members. It was further agreed that these 8.
        comissioners shall meete once every year, besids extraordinarie
        meetings, (according to the fifte article,) to consider, treate, &amp;
        conclude of all affaires belonging to this confederation, which meeting
        shall ever be the first Thursday in September. And y<sup>t</sup> the
        next meeting after the date of these presents, which shall be accounted
        y<sup>e</sup> second meeting, shall be at Boston in y<sup>e</sup>
        Massachusets, the 3. at Hartford, the 4. at New-Haven, the 5. at
        Plimoth, and so in course successively, if in y<sup>e</sup> meane time
        some midle place be not found out and agreed on, which may be comodious
        for all y<sup>e</sup> jurisdictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. It is further agreed, y<sup>t</sup> at each meeting of these 8.
        comissioners, whether ordinarie, or extraordinary, they all 6. of them
        agreeing as before, may chuse a presidente out of them selves, whose
        office &amp; work shall be to take care and directe for order, and a
        comly carrying on of all proceedings in y<sup>e</sup> present meeting;
        but he shall be invested with no such power or respecte, as by which he
        shall hinder y<sup>e</sup> propounding or progrese of any bussines, or
        any way cast y<sup>e</sup> scailes otherwise then in y<sup>e</sup>
        precedente article is agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
        [259] 8. It is also agreed, y<sup>t</sup> the comissioners for this
        confederation hereafter at their meetings, whether ordinary or
        extraordinarie, as they may have comission or opportunitie, doe
        indeaover to frame and establish agreements &amp; orders in generall
        cases of a civill nature, wherin all y<sup>e</sup> plantations are
        interessed, for y<sup>e</sup> preserving of peace amongst them selves,
        and preventing as much as may be all occasions of warr or difference
        with others; as aboute y<sup>e</sup> free &amp; speedy passage of
        justice, in every jurisdiction, to all y<sup>e</sup> confederats equally
        as to their owne; not receiving those y<sup>t</sup> remove from one
        plantation to another without due <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>certificate; how all y<sup>e</sup>
        jurisdictions may carry towards y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, that they neither
        growe insolente, nor be injured without due satisfaction, least warr
        breake in upon the confederats through such miscarriages. It is also
        agreed, y<sup>t</sup> if any servante rune away from his maister into
        another of these confederated jurisdictions, that in such case, upon y<sup>e</sup>
        certificate of one magistrate in the jurisdiction out of which y<sup>e</sup>
        said servante fledd, or upon other due proofe, the said servante shall
        be delivered, either to his maister, or any other y<sup>t</sup> pursues
        &amp; brings such certificate or proofe. And y<sup>t</sup> upon y<sup>e</sup>
        escape of any prisoner whatsoever, or fugitive for any criminall cause,
        whether breaking prison, or getting from y<sup>e</sup> officer, or
        otherwise escaping, upon the certificate of 2. magistrats of y<sup>e</sup>
        jurisdiction out of which y<sup>e</sup> escape is made, that he was a
        prisoner, or such an offender at y<sup>e</sup> time of y<sup>e</sup>
        escape, they magistrats, or sume of them of the jurisdiction wher for y<sup>e</sup>
        presente the said prisoner or fugitive abideth, shall forthwith grante
        such a warrante as y<sup>e</sup> case will beare, for y<sup>e</sup>
        apprehending of any such person, &amp; the delivering of him into y<sup>e</sup>
        hands of y<sup>e</sup> officer, or other person who pursues him. And if
        ther be help required, for y<sup>e</sup> safe returning of any such
        offender, then it shall be granted to him y<sup>t</sup> craves y<sup>e</sup>
        same, he paying the charges therof.
      </p>
      <p>
        9. And for y<sup>t</sup> the justest warrs may be of dangerous
        consequence, espetially to y<sup>e</sup> smaler plantations in these
        United Collonies, it is agreed y<sup>t</sup> neither y<sup>e</sup>
        Massachusets, Plimoth, Conightecutt, nor New-Haven, nor any member of
        any of them, shall at any time hear after begine, undertake, or ingage
        them selves, or this confederation, or any parte therof, in any warr
        whatsoever, (sudden<a name="FNanchor_ET_150" id="FNanchor_ET_150"></a><a

        necessary consequents therof excepted, which are also to be moderated as

        consente and agreemente of y<sup>e</sup> forementioned 8. comissioners,
        or at the least 6. of them, as in y<sup>e</sup> sixt article is
        provided. And y<sup>t</sup> no charge be required of any of they
        confederats, in case of a defensive warr, till y<sup>e</sup> said
        comissioners have mett, and approved y<sup>e</sup> justice of y<sup>e</sup>
        warr, and have agreed upon y<sup>e</sup> sum&#773;e of money to be
        levied, which sume is then to be paid by the severall confederats in
        proportion according to y<sup>e</sup> fourth article.
      </p>
      <p>
        10. That in extraordinary occasions, when meetings are summoned by three
        magistrates of any jurisdiction, or 2. as in y<sup>e</sup> 5. article,
        if any of y<sup>e</sup> comissioners come not, due warning being given
        or sente, it is agreed y<sup>t</sup> 4. of the comissioners shall have
        power to directe a warr which cannot be delayed, and to send for due
        proportions of men out of each jurisdiction, as well as 6. might doe if
        all mett; but not less then 6. shall determine the justice of y<sup>e</sup>
        warr, or alow y<sup>e</sup> demands or bills of charges, or cause any
        levies to be made for y<sup>e</sup> same.
      </p>
      <p>
        11. It is further agreed, y<sup>t</sup> if any of y<sup>e</sup>
        confederats shall hereafter breake any of these presente articles, or be
        any other ways injurious to any one of y<sup>e</sup> other
        jurisdictions, such breach of agreemente or injurie shall be duly
        considered and ordered by y<sup>e</sup> comissioners for y<sup>e</sup>
        other jurisdiction; that both peace and this presente confederation may
        be intirly preserved without violation.
      </p>
      <p>
        12. Lastly, this perpetuall confederation, and y<sup>e</sup> severall
        articles therof being read, and seriously considered, both by y<sup>e</sup>
        Generall Courte for y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, and by y<sup>e</sup>
        comissioners for Plimoth, Conigtecute, &amp; New-Haven, were fully
        alowed &amp; confirmed by 3. of y<sup>e</sup> forenamed confederats,
        namly, y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, Conightecutt, and New-Haven; only y<sup>e</sup>
        comissioners for Plimoth haveing no com&#773;ission to conclude, desired
        respite till they might advise with their Generall Courte; wher upon it
        was agreed and concluded <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504"
        id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>by y<sup>e</sup> said Courte of y<sup>e</sup>
        Massachusets, and the comissioners for y<sup>e</sup> other tow
        confederats, that, if Plimoth consente, then the whole treaty as it
        stands in these present articls is, and shall continue, firme &amp;
        stable without alteration. But if Plimoth come not in, yet y<sup>e</sup>
        other three confederats doe by these presents [260] confeirme y<sup>e</sup>
        whole confederation, and the articles therof; only in September nexte,
        when y<sup>e</sup> second meeting of y<sup>e</sup> com&#773;issioners is
        to be at Boston, new consideration may be taken of y<sup>e</sup> 6.
        article, which concerns number of comissioners for meeting &amp;
        concluding the affaires of this confederation, to y<sup>e</sup>
        satisfaction of y<sup>e</sup> Courte of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, and
        y<sup>e</sup> comissioners for y<sup>e</sup> other 2. confederats, but y<sup>e</sup>
        rest to stand unquestioned. In y<sup>e</sup> testimonie wherof, y<sup>e</sup>
        Generall Courte of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, by ther Secretary, and y<sup>e</sup>
        comissioners for Conightecutt and New-Haven, have subscribed these
        presente articles this 19. of y<sup>e</sup> third month, comonly called
        May, Anno Dom: 1643.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a meeting of y<sup>e</sup> comissioners for y<sup>e</sup>
        confederation held at Boston y<sup>e</sup> 7. of Sept: it appearing that
        the Generall Courte of New-Plimoth, and y<sup>e</sup> severall
        towneshipes therof, have read &amp; considered &amp; approved these
        articles of confederation, as appeareth by com&#773;ission from their
        Generall Courte bearing date y<sup>e</sup> 29. of August, 1643. to M<sup>r</sup>.
        Edward Winslow and M<sup>r</sup>. William Collier, to ratifie and
        confirme y<sup>e</sup> same on their behalfes. We, therfore, y<sup>e</sup>
        Comissioners for y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, Conightecutt, &amp; New
        Haven, doe also, for our severall goverments, subscribe unto them.

    <p>
      These were y<sup>e</sup> articles of agreemente in y<sup>e</sup> union and
      confederation which they now first entered into; and in <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>this
      their first meeting, held at Boston y<sup>e</sup> day &amp; year
      abovesaid, amongst other things they had this matter of great consequence
      to considere on: the Narigansets, after y<sup>e</sup> subduing of y<sup>e</sup>
      Pequents, thought to have ruled over all y<sup>e</sup> Indeans aboute
      them; but y<sup>e</sup> English, espetially those of Conightecutt holding
      correspondencie &amp; frenship with Uncass, sachem of y<sup>e</sup>
      Monhigg Indeans which lived nere them, (as y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets had
      done with y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets,) and he had been faithful to them in
      y<sup>e</sup> Pequente warr, they were ingaged to supporte him in his just
      liberties, and were contented y<sup>t</sup> such of y<sup>e</sup>
      surviving Pequents as had submited to him should remaine with him and
      quietly under his protection. This did much increase his power and
      augmente his greatnes, which y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets could not indure to
      see. But Myantinomo, their cheefe sachem, (an ambitious &amp; politick
      man,) sought privatly and by trearchery (according to y<sup>e</sup> Indean
      maner) to make him away, by hiring some to kill him. Sometime they assayed
      to poyson him; that not takeing, then in y<sup>e</sup> night time to knock
      him on y<sup>e</sup> head in his house, or secretly to shoot him, and such
      like attempts. But none of these taking effecte, he made open warr upon
      him (though it was against y<sup>e</sup> covenants both betweene y<sup>e</sup>
      English &amp; them, as also betweene them selves, and a plaine breach of y<sup>e</sup>
      same). He came suddanly upon him with 900. or 1000. men (never denouncing
      any warr before). Y<sup>e</sup> others power at y<sup>t</sup> presente was
      not above halfe so many; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506"
      id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>but it pleased God to give Uncass y<sup>e</sup>
      victory, and he slew many of his men, and wounded many more; but y<sup>e</sup>
      cheefe of all was, he tooke Miantinomo prisoner. And seeing he was a
      greate man, and y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets a potente people &amp; would
      seeke revenge, he would doe nothing in y<sup>e</sup> case without y<sup>e</sup>
      advise of y<sup>e</sup> English; so he (by y<sup>e</sup> help &amp;
      direction of those of Conightecutt) kept him prisoner till this meeting of
      y<sup>e</sup> comissioners. The comissioners weighed y<sup>e</sup> cause
      and passages, as they were clearly represented &amp; sufficently evidenced
      betwixte Uncass and Myantinomo; and the things being duly considered, the
      comissioners apparently saw y<sup>t</sup> Uncass could not be safe whilst
      Miantynomo lived, but, either by secrete trechery or open force, his life
      would still be in danger. Wherfore they thought he might justly put such a
      false &amp; bloud-thirstie enimie to death; but in his owne jurisdiction,
      not in y<sup>e</sup> English plantations. And they advised, in y<sup>e</sup>
      maner of his death all mercy and moderation should be showed, contrary to
      y<sup>e</sup> practise of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, who exercise torturs and
      cruelty. And, [261] Uncass having hitherto shewed him selfe a freind to y<sup>e</sup>
      English, and in this craving their advise, if the Narigansett Indeans or
      others shall unjustly assaulte Uncass for this execution, upon notice and
      request, y<sup>e</sup> English promise to assiste and protecte him as farr
      as they may aga&#299;ste such violence.

    <p>
      This was y<sup>e</sup> issue of this bussines. The reasons and passages
      hereof are more at large to be seene in y<sup>e</sup> acts <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>&amp;
      records of this meeting of y<sup>e</sup> comissioners. And Uncass follewd
      this advise, and accordingly executed him, in a very faire maner, acording
      as they advised, with due respecte to his honour &amp; greatnes. But what
      followed on y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets parte will appear hear after.

      Many having left this place (as is before noted) by reason of the
      straightnes &amp; barrennes of y<sup>e</sup> same, and their finding of
      better accommodations elsewher, more sutable to their ends &amp; minds;
      and sundrie others still upon every occasion desiring their dismissions,
      the church begane seriously to thinke whether it were not better joyntly
      to remove to some other place, then to be thus weakened, and as it were
      insensibly dissolved. Many meetings and much consultation was held
      hearaboute, and diverse were mens minds and opinions. Some were still for
      staying togeather in this place, aledging men might hear live, if they
      would be contente with their condition; and y<sup>t</sup> it was not for
      wante or necessitie so much y<sup>t</sup> they removed, as for y<sup>e</sup>
      enriching of them selves. Others were resolute upon removall, and so
      signified y<sup>t</sup> hear y<sup>ey</sup> could not stay; but if y<sup>e</sup>
      church did not remove, they must; insomuch as many were swayed, rather
      then ther should be a dissolution, to condescend to a removall, if a fitt
      place could be found, that might more conveniently and comfortablie <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>receive y<sup>e</sup>
      whole, with such accession of others as might come to them, for their
      better strength &amp; subsistence; and some such like cautions and
      limitations. So as, with y<sup>e</sup> afforesaide provissos, y<sup>e</sup>
      greater parte consented to a removall to a place called Nawsett, which had
      been superficially veiwed and y<sup>e</sup> good will of y<sup>e</sup>
      purchassers (to whom it belonged) obtained, with some addition thertoo
      from y<sup>e</sup> Courte. But now they begane to see their errour, that
      they had given away already the best &amp; most com&#773;odious places to
      others, and now wanted them selves; for this place was about 50. myles
      from hence, and at an outside of y<sup>e</sup> countrie, remote from all
      society; also, that it would prove so straite, as it would not be
      competente to receive y<sup>e</sup> whole body, much less be capable of
      any addition or increase; so as (at least in a shorte time) they should be
      worse ther then they are now hear. The which, with sundery other like
      considerations and inconveniences, made them chaing their resolutions; but
      such as were before resolved upon removall tooke advantage of this
      agreemente, &amp; wente on notwithstanding, neither could y<sup>e</sup>
      rest hinder them, they haveing made some begin&#773;ing. And thus was this
      poore church left, like an anciente mother, growne olde, and forsaken of
      her children, (though not in their affections,) yett in regarde of their
      bodily presence and personall helpfullness. Her anciente members being
      most of them worne away by death; and these of later time being <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>like
      children translated into other families, and she like a widow left only to
      trust in God. Thus she that had made many rich became her selfe poore.

      <p>
        Wheras, by a wise providence of God, tow of y<sup>e</sup> jurisdictions
        in y<sup>e</sup> westerne parts, viz. Conightecutt &amp; New-haven, have
        beene latly exercised by sundrie insolencies &amp; outrages from y<sup>e</sup>
        Indeans; as, first, an Englishman, runing from his m<sup>r</sup> out of
        y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets, was murdered in y<sup>e</sup> woods, in or
        nere y<sup>e</sup> limites of Conightecute jurisdiction; and aboute 6.
        weeks after, upon discovery by an Indean, y<sup>e</sup> Indean sagamore
        in these parts promised to deliver the murderer to y<sup>e</sup>
        English, bound; and having accordingly brought him within y<sup>e</sup>
        sight of Uncaway, by their joynte consente, as it is informed, he was
        ther unbound, and left to shifte for him selfe; wherupon 10. Englishmen
        forthwith coming to y<sup>e</sup> place, being sente by M<sup>r</sup>.
        Ludlow, at y<sup>e</sup> Indeans desire, to receive y<sup>e</sup>
        murderer, who seeing him escaped, layed hold of 8. of y<sup>e</sup>
        Indeans ther presente, amongst whom ther was a sagamore or 2. and kept
        them in hold 2. days, till 4. sagamors ingaged themselves within one
        month to deliver y<sup>e</sup> prisoner. And about a weeke after this
        agreemente, an Indean came presumtuously and with guile, in y<sup>e</sup>
        day time, and murtherously assalted an English woman in her house at
        Stamford, and by 3. wounds, supposed mortall, left her for dead, after
        he had robbed y<sup>e</sup> house. By which passages y<sup>e</sup>
        English were provoked, &amp; called to a due consideration of their owne
        saftie; and y<sup>e</sup> Indeans generally in those parts arose in an
        hostile maner, refused to come to y<sup>e</sup> English to carry on
        treaties of peace, departed from their wigwames, left their corne
        unweeded, and shewed them selves tumultuously <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>about some of y<sup>e</sup>
        English plantations, &amp; shott of peeces within hearing of y<sup>e</sup>
        towne; and some Indeans came to y<sup>e</sup> English &amp; tould them y<sup>e</sup>
        Indeans would fall upon them. So y<sup>t</sup> most of y<sup>e</sup>
        English thought it unsafe to travell in those parts by land, and some of
        y<sup>e</sup> plantations were put upon strong watchs and ward, night
        &amp; day, &amp; could not attend their private occasions, and yet
        distrusted their owne strength for their defence. Wherupon Hartford
        &amp; New-Haven were sent unto for aide, and saw cause both to send into
        y<sup>e</sup> weaker parts of their owne jurisdiction thus in danger,
        and New-Haven, for conveniencie of situation, sente aide to Uncaway,
        though belonging to Conightecutt. Of all which passages they presently
        acquainted y<sup>e</sup> comissioners in y<sup>e</sup> Bay, &amp; had y<sup>e</sup>
        allowance &amp; approbation from y<sup>e</sup> Generall Courte ther,
        with directions neither to hasten warr nor to bear such insolencies too
        longe. Which courses, though chargable to them selves, yet through Gods
        blessing they hope fruite is, &amp; will be, sweete and wholsome to all
        y<sup>e</sup> collonies; the murderers are since delivered to justice,
        the publick peace preserved for y<sup>e</sup> presente, &amp;
        probabillitie it may be better secured for y<sup>e</sup> future.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Thus this mischeefe was prevented, and y<sup>e</sup> fear of a warr hereby
      diverted. But now an other broyle was begune by y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets;
      though they unjustly had made warr upon Uncass, (as is before declared,)
      and had, y<sup>e</sup> winter before this, ernestly presed y<sup>e</sup>
      Gove<sup>r</sup> of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets that they might still make
      warr upon them to revenge the death of their sagamore, w<sup>ch</sup>,
      being taken prisoner, was by them put to death, (as before was noted,)
      pretending that they had first received and accepted his ransome, and then
      put him to death. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>But
      y<sup>e</sup> Gove<sup>r</sup> refused their presents, and tould them y<sup>t</sup>
      it was them selves had done y<sup>e</sup> wronge, &amp; broaken y<sup>e</sup>
      conditions of peace; and he nor y<sup>e</sup> English neither could nor
      would allow them to make any further warr upon him, but if they did, must
      assiste him, &amp; oppose them; but if it did appeare, upon good proofe,
      that he had received a ransome for his life, before he put him to death,
      when y<sup>e</sup> comissioners mett, they should have a fair hearing, and
      they would cause Uncass to returne y<sup>e</sup> same. But
      notwithstanding, at y<sup>e</sup> spring of y<sup>e</sup> year they
      gathered a great power, and fell upon Uncass, and slue sundrie of his men,
      and wounded more, and also had some loss them selves. Uncass cald for aide
      from y<sup>e</sup> English; they tould him what y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets
      objected, he deney the same; they tould him it must come to triall, and if
      he was inocente, if y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets would not desiste, they
      would aide &amp; assiste him. So at this meeting they [263] sent both to
      Uncass &amp; y<sup>e</sup> Narrigansets, and required their sagamors to
      come or send to y<sup>e</sup> comissioners now mete at Hartford, and they
      should have a faire &amp; inpartiall hearing in all their greevances, and
      would endeavor y<sup>t</sup> all wrongs should be rectified wher they
      should be found; and they promised that they should safly come and returne
      without any danger or molestation; and sundry y<sup>e</sup> like things,
      as appears more at large in y<sup>e</sup> messengers instructions. Upon w<sup>ch</sup>
      the Narigansets sent one sagamore and some other deputies, with full <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>power to
      doe in y<sup>e</sup> case as should be meete. Uncass came in person,
      accompanyed with some cheefe aboute him. After the agitation of y<sup>e</sup>
      bussines, y<sup>e</sup> issue was this. The comissioners declared to the
      Narigansett deputies as followeth.
    </p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        1. That they did not find any proofe of any ransome agreed on.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. It appeared not y<sup>t</sup> any wampam had been paied as a ransome,
        or any parte of a ransome, for Myantinomos life.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. That if they had in any measure proved their charge against Uncass,
        the comissioners would have required him to have made answerable
        satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. That if hereafter they can make satisfing profe, y<sup>e</sup>
        English will consider y<sup>e</sup> same, &amp; proceed accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. The comissioners did require y<sup>t</sup> neither them selves nor y<sup>e</sup>
        Nyanticks make any warr or injurious assaulte upon Unquass or any of his
        company untill they make profe of y<sup>e</sup> ransume charged, and y<sup>t</sup>
        due satisfaction be deneyed, unless he first assaulte them.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. That if they assaulte Uncass, the English are engaged to assist him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearupon y<sup>e</sup> Narigansette sachim, advising with y<sup>e</sup>
        other deputies, ingaged him selfe in the behalfe of y<sup>e</sup>
        Narigansets &amp; Nyanticks that no hostile acts should be comitted upon
        Uncass, or any of his, untill after y<sup>e</sup> next planting of
        corne; and y<sup>t</sup> after that, before they begine any warr, they
        will give 30. days warning to y<sup>e</sup> Gove<sup>r</sup> of the
        Massachusets or Conightecutt. The comissioners approving of this offer,
        and taking their ingagmente under their hands, required Uncass, as he
        expected y<sup>e</sup> continuance of y<sup>e</sup> favour of the
        English, to observe the same termes of peace with y<sup>e</sup>
        Narigansets and theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
        These foregoing conclusions were subscribed by y<sup>e</sup>
        comissioners, for y<sup>e</sup> severall jurisdictions, y<sup>e</sup>
        19. of Sept: 1644.

    </p>
    <p>
      The comissioners this year were caled to meete to-gither at Boston, before
      their ordinarie time; partly in regard of some differances falen betweene
      y<sup>e</sup> French and y<sup>e</sup> govermente of the Massachusets,
      about their aiding of Munseire Latore against Munsseire de Aulney, and
      partly aboute y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, who had broaken y<sup>e</sup> former
      agreements aboute the peace concluded y<sup>e</sup> last year. This
      meeting was held at Boston, y<sup>e</sup> 28. of July.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>Besids
      some underhand assualts made on both sids, the Narigansets gathered a
      great power, and fell upon Uncass, and slew many of his men, and wounded
      more, by reason y<sup>t</sup> they farr exseeded him in number, and had
      gott store of peeces, with which they did him most hurte. And as they did
      this withoute y<sup>e</sup> knowledg and consente of y<sup>e</sup>
      English, (contrary to former agreemente,) so they were resolved to
      prosecute y<sup>e</sup> same, notwithstanding any thing y<sup>e</sup>
      English said or should doe against them. So, being incouraged by ther late
      victorie, and promise of assistance from y<sup>e</sup> Mowaks, (being a
      strong, warlike, and desperate people,) they had allready devoured Uncass
      &amp; his, in their hops; and surly they had done it in deed, if the
      English had not timly sett in for his aide. For those of Conightecute sent
      him 40. men, who were a garison to him, till y<sup>e</sup> comissioners
      could meete and take further order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being thus mett, they forthwith sente 3. messengers, viz. Sargent John
      Davis, Benedicte Arnold, and Francis Smith, with full &amp; ample
      instructions, both to y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets and Uncass; to require
      them y<sup>t</sup> they should either come in person or send sufficiente
      men fully instructed to deale in y<sup>e</sup> bussines; and if they
      refused or delayed, to let them know (according to former agreements) y<sup>t</sup>
      the English are engaged to assiste against these hostile invasions, and y<sup>t</sup>
      they have sente their men to defend Uncass, and to know of y<sup>e</sup>
      Narigansets whether they will stand to y<sup>e</sup> former peace, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>or they
      will assaulte y<sup>e</sup> English also, that they may provid
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But y<sup>e</sup> messengers returned, not only with a sleighting, but a
      threatening answer from the Narigansets (as will more appear hereafter).
      Also they brought a letter from M<sup>r</sup>. Roger Williams, wherin he
      assures them that y<sup>e</sup> warr would presenly breake forth, &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
      whole country would be all of a flame. And y<sup>t</sup> the sachems of y<sup>e</sup>
      Narigansets had concluded a newtrality with y<sup>e</sup> English of
      Providence and those of Aquidnett Iland. Wherupon y<sup>e</sup>
      comissioners, considering y<sup>e</sup> great danger &amp; provocations
      offered, and y<sup>e</sup> necessitie we should be put unto of making warr
      with y<sup>e</sup> Narigansetts, and being also carfull, in a matter of so
      great waight &amp; generall concernmente, to see y<sup>e</sup> way
      cleared, and to give satisfaction to all y<sup>e</sup> colonies, did
      thinke fitte to advise with such of y<sup>e</sup> magistrats &amp; elders
      of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets as were then at hand, and also with some of
      y<sup>e</sup> cheefe millitary comanders ther; who being assembled, it was
      then agreed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      First, y<sup>t</sup> our ingagmente bound us to aide &amp; defend Uncass.
      2. That this ayde could not be intended only to defend him &amp; his
      forte, or habitation, but (according to y<sup>e</sup> comone acceptation
      of such covenants, or ingagments, considered with y<sup>e</sup> grounds or
      occasion therof) so to ayde him as he might be preserved in his liberty
      and estate. 3<sup>ly</sup>. That this ayde [265] must be speedy, least he
      might be swalowed up in y<sup>e</sup> mean time, and <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>so come to late. 4<sup>ly</sup>.
      The justice of this warr being cleared to our selves and y<sup>e</sup>
      rest then presente, it was thought meete y<sup>t</sup> the case should be
      stated, and y<sup>e</sup> reasons &amp; grounds of y<sup>e</sup> warr
      declared and published. 5<sup>ly</sup>. That a day of humilliation should
      be apoynted, which was y<sup>e</sup> 5. day of y<sup>e</sup> weeke
      following. 6<sup>ly</sup>. It was then allso agreed by y<sup>e</sup>
      comissioners that y<sup>e</sup> whole number of men to be raised in all y<sup>e</sup>
      colonies should be 300. Wherof from y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets a 190.
      Plimoth, 40. Conightecute, 40. New-Haven, 30. And considering y<sup>t</sup>
      Uncass was in present danger, 40. men of this number were forthwith sente
      from y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets for his sucoure; and it was but neede, for
      y<sup>e</sup> other 40. from Conightecutt had order to stay but a month,
      &amp; their time being out, they returned; and y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets,
      hearing therof, tooke the advantage, and came suddanly upon him, and gave
      him another blow, to his further loss, and were ready to doe y<sup>e</sup>
      like againe; but these 40. men being arrived, they returned, and did
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The declaration which they sett forth I shall not transcribe, it being
      very larg, and put forth in printe, to which I referr those y<sup>t</sup>
      would see y<sup>e</sup> same, in which all passages are layed open from y<sup>e</sup>
      first. I shall only note their prowd carriage, and answers to y<sup>e</sup>
      3. messengers sent from y<sup>e</sup> comissioners. They received them
      with scorne &amp; contempte, and tould them they resolved to have no peace
      without Uncass his head; also they gave them this further answer: that it
      mattered not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>who
      begane y<sup>e</sup> warr, they were resolved to follow it, and that y<sup>e</sup>
      English should withdraw their garison from Uncass, or they would procure y<sup>e</sup>
      Mowakes against them; and withall gave them this threatening answer: that
      they would lay y<sup>e</sup> English catle on heaps, as high as their
      houses, and y<sup>t</sup> no English-man should sturr out of his dore to
      pisse, but he should be kild. And wheras they required guids to pass throw
      their countrie, to deliver their message to Uncass from y<sup>e</sup>
      comissioners, they deneyed them, but at length (in way of scorne) offered
      them an old Pequente woman. Besids allso they conceived them selves in
      danger, for whilst y<sup>e</sup> interpretour was speakeing with them
      about y<sup>e</sup> answer he should returne, 3. men came &amp; stood
      behind him with ther hatchets, according to their murderous maner; but one
      of his fellows gave him notice of it, so they broak of &amp; came away;
      with sundry such like affrontes, which made those Indeans they carryed
      with them to rune away for fear, and leave them to goe home as they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus whilst y<sup>e</sup> comissioners in care of y<sup>e</sup> publick
      peace sought to quench y<sup>e</sup> fire kindled amongst y<sup>e</sup>
      Indeans, these children of strife breath out threatenings, provocations,
      and warr against y<sup>e</sup> English them selves. So that, unless they
      should dishonour &amp; provoak God, by violating a just ingagmente, and
      expose y<sup>e</sup> colonies to contempte &amp; danger from y<sup>e</sup>
      barbarians, they cannot but exerciese force, when no other means will
      prevaile to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>reduse
      y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets &amp; their confederats to a more just &amp;
      sober temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      So as here upon they went on to hasten y<sup>e</sup> preparations,
      according to y<sup>e</sup> former agreemente, and sent to Plimoth to send
      forth their 40. men with all speed, to lye at Seacunke, least any deanger
      should befalle it, before y<sup>e</sup> rest were ready, it lying next y<sup>e</sup>
      enemie, and ther to stay till y<sup>e</sup> Massachusetts should joyne
      with them. Allso Conigtecute &amp; Newhaven forces were to joyne
      togeather, and march with all speed, and y<sup>e</sup> Indean confederats
      of those parts with them. All which was done accordingly; and the
      souldiers of this place were at Seacunk, the place of their rendevouze, 8.
      or 10. days before y<sup>e</sup> rest were ready; they were well armed all
      with snaphance peeces, and wente under y<sup>e</sup> camand of Captain
      [266] Standish. Those from other places were led likwise by able
      comanders,<a name="FNanchor_EU_151" id="FNanchor_EU_151"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_EU_151" class="fnanchor">[EU]</a> as Captaine Mason for
      Conigtecute, &amp;c.; and Majore Gibons was made generall over y<sup>e</sup>
      whole, with such comissions &amp; instructions as was meete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon y<sup>e</sup> suden dispatch of these souldiears, (the present
      necessitie requiring it,) the deputies of y<sup>e</sup> Massachusetts
      Courte (being now assembled im&#773;ediatly after y<sup>e</sup> setting
      forth of their 40. men) made a question whether it was legally done,
      without their comission. It was answered, that howsoever it did properly
      belong to y<sup>e</sup> authority of y<sup>e</sup> severall jurisdictions
      (after <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup>
      warr was agreed upon by y<sup>e</sup> comissioners, &amp; the number of
      men) to provid y<sup>e</sup> men &amp; means to carry on y<sup>e</sup>
      warr; yet in this presente case, the proceeding of y<sup>e</sup>
      comissioners and y<sup>e</sup> comission given was as sufficiente as if it
      had been done by y<sup>e</sup> Generall Courte.
    </p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        First, it was a case of such presente &amp; urgente necessitie, as could
        not stay y<sup>e</sup> calling of y<sup>e</sup> Courte or Counsell. 2<sup>ly</sup>.
        In y<sup>e</sup> Articles of Confederation, power is given to y<sup>e</sup>
        comissioners to consult, order, &amp; determine all affaires of warr,
        &amp;c. And y<sup>e</sup> word <i>determine</i> comprehends all acts of
        authority belonging therunto.
      </p>
      <p>
        3<sup>ly</sup>. The comissioners are y<sup>e</sup> judges of y<sup>e</sup>
        necessitie of the expedition.
      </p>
      <p>
        4<sup>ly</sup>. The Generall Courte have made their owne comissioners
        their sole counsell for these affires.
      </p>
      <p>
        5<sup>ly</sup>. These counsels could not have had their due effecte
        excepte they had power to proceede in this case, as they have done;
        which were to make y<sup>e</sup> comissioners power, and y<sup>e</sup>
        maine end of y<sup>e</sup> confederation, to be frustrate, and that
        mearly for observing a ceremony.
      </p>
      <p>
        6<sup>ly</sup>. The comissioners haveing sole power to manage y<sup>e</sup>
        warr for number of men, for time, place, &amp;c., they only know their
        owne counsells, &amp; <i>determinations</i>, and therfore none can
        grante com&#773;ission to acte according to these but them selves.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      All things being thus in readines, and some of y<sup>e</sup> souldiers
      gone forth, and the rest ready to march, the comissioners thought it meete
      before any hostile acte was performed, to cause a presente to be returned,
      which had been sente to y<sup>e</sup> Gove<sup>r</sup> of the
      Massachusetts from y<sup>e</sup> Narigansett sachems, but not by <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>him
      received, but layed up to be accepted or refused as they should carry them
      selves, and observe y<sup>e</sup> covenants. Therfore they violating the
      same, &amp; standing out thus to a warr, it was againe returned, by 2.
      messengers &amp; an interpretour. And further to let know that their men
      already sent to Uncass (&amp; other wher sent forth) have hitherto had
      express order only to stand upon his &amp; their owne defence, and not to
      attempte any invasion of y<sup>e</sup> Narigansetts country; and yet if
      they may have due reperation for what is past, and good securitie for y<sup>e</sup>
      future, it shall appear they are as desirous of peace, and shall be as
      tender of y<sup>e</sup> Narigansets blood as ever. If therefore Pessecuss,
      Innemo, writh other sachemes, will (without further delay) come along with
      you to Boston, the comissioners doe promise &amp; assure them, they shall
      have free liberty to come, and retourne without molestation or any just
      greevance from y<sup>e</sup> English. But deputies will not now serve, nor
      may the preparations in hand be now stayed, or y<sup>e</sup> directions
      given recalled, till y<sup>e</sup> forementioned sagamors come, and some
      further order be taken. But if they will have nothing but warr, the
      English are providing, and will proceede accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pessecouss, Mixano, &amp; Witowash, 3. principall sachems of y<sup>e</sup>
      Narigansett Indeans, and Awasequen, deputie for y<sup>e</sup> Nyanticks,
      with a large traine of men, within a few days after came to Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
      And to omitte all other circomstances and debats y<sup>t</sup> past
      betweene them and the comissioners, they came to this conclusion
      following.
    </p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        [267] 1. It was agreed betwixte y<sup>e</sup> comissioners of y<sup>e</sup>
        United Collonies, and y<sup>e</sup> forementioned sagamores, &amp;
        Niantick deputie, that y<sup>e</sup> said Narigansets &amp; Niantick
        sagamores should pay or cause to be payed at Boston, to y<sup>e</sup>
        Massachusets comissioners, y<sup>e</sup> full sume of 2000. fathome of
        good white wampame, or a third parte of black wampampeage, in 4.
        payments; namely, 500. fathome within 20. days, 500. fathome within 4.
        months, 500. fathome at or before next planting time, and 500. fathome.
        within 2. years next after y<sup>e</sup> date of these presents; which
        2000. fathome y<sup>e</sup> comissioners accepte for satisfaction of
        former charges expended.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. The foresaid sagamors &amp; deputie (on y<sup>e</sup> behalfe of y<sup>e</sup>
        Narigansett &amp; Niantick Indeans) hereby promise &amp; covenante that
        they upon demand and profe satisfie &amp; restore unto Uncass, y<sup>e</sup>
        Mohigan sagamore, all such captives, whether men, or women, or children,
        and all such canowes, as they or any of their men have taken, or as many
        of their owne canowes in y<sup>e</sup> roome of them, full as good as
        they were, with full satisfaction for all such corne as they or any of
        theire men have spoyled or destroyed, of his or his mens, since last
        planting time; and y<sup>e</sup> English comissioners hereby promise y<sup>t</sup>
        Uncass shall doe y<sup>e</sup> like.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Wheras ther are sundry differences &amp; greevances betwixte
        Narigansett &amp; Niantick Indeans, and Uncass &amp; his men, (which in
        Uncass his absence cannot now be detirmined,) it is hearby agreed y<sup>t</sup>
        Nariganset &amp; Niantick sagamores either come them selves, or send
        their deputies to y<sup>e</sup> next meeting of y<sup>e</sup>
        comissioners for y<sup>e</sup> collonies, either at New-Haven in Sep<sup>t</sup>
        1646. or sooner (upon conveniente warning, <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>if y<sup>e</sup> said
        comissioners doe meete sooner), fully instructed to declare &amp; make
        due proofe of their injuries, and to submite to y<sup>e</sup> judgmente
        of y<sup>e</sup> comissioners, in giving or receiving satisfaction; and
        y<sup>e</sup> said comissioners (not doubting but Uncass will either
        come him selfe, or send his deputies, in like maner furnished) promising
        to give a full hearing to both parties with equall justice, without any
        partiall respects, according to their allegations and profs.
      </p>

      And thus was y<sup>e</sup> warr at this time stayed and prevented.<span

    <p>
      About y<sup>e</sup> midle of May, this year, came in 3. ships into this
      harbor, in warrlike order; they were found to be men of warr. The captains
      name was Crumwell, who had taken sundrie prizes from y<sup>e</sup>
      Spaniards in y<sup>e</sup> West Indies. He had a comission from y<sup>e</sup>
      Earle of Warwick. He had abord his vessels aboute 80. lustie men, (but
      very unruly,) who, after they came ashore, did so distemper them selves
      with drinke as they became like madd-men; and though some of them were
      punished &amp; imprisoned, yet could they hardly be restrained; yet in y<sup>e</sup>
      ende they became more moderate &amp; orderly. They continued here aboute a
      month or 6. weeks, and then went to y<sup>e</sup> Massachusets; in which
      time they spente and scattered a great deale of money among y<sup>e</sup>
      people, and yet more sine (I fear) then money, notwithstanding all y<sup>e</sup>
      care &amp; watchfullnes that was used towards them, to prevente what might
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      In which time one sadd accidente fell out. A desperate fellow of y<sup>e</sup>
      company fell a quarling with some of his company. His captine com&#773;anded
      him to be quiet &amp; surcease his quarelling; but he would not, but
      reviled his captaine with base language, &amp; in y<sup>e</sup> end halfe
      drew his rapier, &amp; intended to rune at his captien; but he closed with
      him, and wrasted his rapier from him, and gave him a boxe on y<sup>e</sup>
      earr; but he would not give over, but still assaulted his captaine.
      Wherupon <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>he
      tooke y<sup>e</sup> same rapier as it was in y<sup>e</sup> scaberd, and
      gave him a blow with y<sup>e</sup> hilts; but it light on his head, &amp;
      y<sup>e</sup> smal end of y<sup>e</sup> bar of y<sup>e</sup> rapier hilts
      peirct his scull, &amp; he dyed a few days after. But y<sup>e</sup>
      captaine was cleared by a counsell of warr. This fellow was so desperate a
      quareller as y<sup>e</sup> captaine was faine many times to chaine him
      under hatches from hurting his fellows, as y<sup>e</sup> company did
      testifie; and this was his end.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Captaine Thomas Cromuell sett forth another vioage to the Westindeas,
      from the Bay of the Massachusets, well maned &amp; victuled; and was out
      3. years, and tooke sundry prises, and returned rich unto the
      Massachusets, and ther dyed the same som&#773;ere, having gott a fall from
      his horse, in which fall he fell on his rapeir hilts, and so brused his
      body as he shortly after dyed therof, with some other distempers, which
      brought him into a feavor. Some observed that ther might be somthing of
      the hand of God herein; that as the forenamed man dyed of y<sup>e</sup>
      blow he gave him with y<sup>e</sup> rapeir hilts, so his owne death was
      occationed by a like means.

      This year M<sup>r</sup>. Edward Winslow went into England, upon this
      occation: some discontented persons under y<sup>e</sup> govermente of the
      Massachusets sought to trouble their peace, and disturbe, if not innovate,
      their govermente, by laying many [270] scandals upon them; and intended to
      prosecute against them in England, by petitioning &amp; complaining to the
      Parlemente. Allso <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>Samuell
      Gorton &amp; his company made complaints against them; so as they made
      choyse of M<sup>r</sup>. Winslow to be their agente, to make their
      defence, and gave him comission &amp; instructions for that end; in which
      he so carried him selfe as did well answer their ends, and cleared them
      from any blame or dishonour, to the shame of their adversaries. But by
      reason of the great alterations in the State, he was detained longer then
      was expected; and afterwards fell into other imployments their, so as he
      hath now bene absente this 4. years, which hath been much to the weakning
      of this govermente, without whose consente he tooke these imployments upon
      him.

          sacred bond, whilst inviollably preserved! how sweete and precious
          were the fruits that flowed from y<sup>e</sup> same, but when this
          fidelity decayed, then their ruine approached. O that these anciente
          members had not dyed, or been dissipated, (if it had been the will of
          God) or els that this holy care and constante faithfullnes had still
          lived, and remained with those that survived, and were in times
          afterwards added unto them. But (alass) that subtill serpente hath
          slylie wound in himselfe under faire pretences of necessitie and y<sup>e</sup>
          like, to untwiste these sacred bonds and tyes, and as it were
          insensibly by degrees to dissolve, or in a great measure to weaken, y<sup>e</sup>
          same. I have been happy, in my first times, to see, and with much
          comforte to injoye, the blessed fruits of this sweete communion, but
          it is now a parte of my miserie in old age, to find and feele y<sup>e</sup>
          decay and wante therof (in a great measure), and with greefe and

          here omite how, notwithstand all their great paines &amp; industrie,
          and y<sup>e</sup> great hops of a large cropp, the Lord seemed to
          blast, &amp; take away the same, and to threaten further &amp; more
          sore famine unto them, by a great drought which continued from y<sup>e</sup>
          3. weeke in May, till about y<sup>e</sup> midle of July, without any
          raine, and with great heat (for y<sup>e</sup> most parte), insomuch as
          y<sup>e</sup> corne begane to wither away, though it was set with
          fishe, the moysture wherof helped it much. Yet at length it begane to
          languish sore, and some of y<sup>e</sup> drier grounds were partched
          like withered hay, part wherof was never recovered. Upon which they
          sett a parte a solemne day of humilliation, to seek y<sup>e</sup> Lord
          by humble &amp; fervente prayer, in this great distrese. And he was
          pleased to give them a gracious &amp; speedy answer, both to their
          owne, &amp; the Indeans admiration, that lived amongest them. For all
          y<sup>e</sup> morning, and greatest part of the day, it was clear
          weather &amp; very hotte, and not a cloud or any signe of raine to be
          seen, yet toward evening it begane to overcast, and shortly after to
          raine, with shuch sweete and gentle showers, as gave them cause of
          rejoyceing, &amp; blesing God. It came, without either wind, or
          thunder, or any violence, and by degreese in y<sup>t</sup> abundance,
          as that y<sup>e</sup> earth was thorowly wete and soked therwith.
          Which did so apparently revive &amp; quicken y<sup>e</sup> decayed
          corne &amp; other fruits, as was wonderfull to see, and made y<sup>e</sup>
          Indeans astonished to behold; and afterwards the Lord sent them shuch
          seasonable showers, with enterchange of faire warme weather, as,
          through his blessing, caused a fruitfull &amp; liberall harvest, to
          their no small comforte and rejoycing. For which mercie (in time
          conveniente) they also sett aparte a day of thanksgiveing. This being
          overslipt in its place, I thought meet here to inserte y<sup>e</sup>
          same.

          the names of the adventurers subscribed to this paper, taken from
          Bradford's Letter-Book, 1 Mass. Hist. Coll., III. 48; being forty-two
          in number. The names of six of these persons are found subsequently
          among the members of the Massachusetts Company, viz. John White, John
          Pocock, Thomas Goffe, Samuel Sharpe, John Revell, and Thomas Andrews.
          Mr. Haven, who edited the Records of the Massachusetts Company, is of
          opinion that the first person on the list is the celebrated clergyman
          of Dorchester, the reputed author of the Planter's Plea. Emnu. Alltham
          is probably the same person named in the Council Records, under date
          January 21. 1622-3: "Emanuel Altum to command the Pinnace built for
          Mr. Peirce's Plantation." Smith speaks of "Captaine <i>Altom</i>" as
          commanding this vessell, but Morton says the name of the master of the
          Little James was Mr. Bridges, who it appears was drowned at
          Damariscove, in March, 1624. See Coll. of the Amer. Antiq. Soc., III.
          26, 62, Preface; Felt's MS. Memoranda from the Council Records;

        <p>
          We cannot but take notice how y<sup>e</sup> Lord hath been pleased to
          crosse our proseedings, and caused many disasters to befale us therin.
          I conceive y<sup>e</sup> only reason to be, we, or many of us, aimed
          at other ends then Gods glorie; but now I hope y<sup>t</sup> cause is
          taken away; the bargen being fully concluded, as farr as our powers
          will reach, and confirmed under our hands &amp; seals, to M<sup>r</sup>.
          Allerton &amp; y<sup>e</sup> rest of his &amp; your copartners. But
          for my owne parte, I confess as I was loath to hinder y<sup>e</sup>
          full confirming of it, being y<sup>e</sup> first propounder ther of at
          our meeting; so on y<sup>e</sup> other side, I was as unwilling to set
          my hand to y<sup>e</sup> sale, being y<sup>e</sup> receiver of most
          part of y<sup>e</sup> adventurs, and a second causer of much of y<sup>e</sup>
          ingagments; and one more threatened, being most envied &amp; aimed at
          (if they could find any stepe to ground their malice on) then any
          other whosoever. I profess I know no just cause they ever had, or
          have, so to doe; neither shall it ever be proved y<sup>t</sup> I have
          wronged them or any of y<sup>e</sup> adventurers, wittingly or
          willingly, one peny in y<sup>e</sup> disbursing of so many pounds in
          those 2. years trouble. No, y<sup>e</sup> sole cause why they maligne
          me (as I &amp; others conceived) was y<sup>t</sup> I would not side
          with them against you, &amp; the going over of y<sup>e</sup> Leyden
          people. But as I then card not, so now I litle fear what they can doe;
          yet charge &amp; trouble I know they may cause me to be at. And for
          these reasons, I would gladly have perswaded the other 4. to have
          sealed to this bargaine, and left me out, but they would not; so
          rather then it should faile, M<sup>r</sup>. Alerton having taken so
          much pains, I have sealed with y<sup>e</sup> rest; with this proviso
          &amp; promise of his, y<sup>t</sup> if any trouble arise hear, you are
          to bear halfe y<sup>e</sup> charge. Wherfore now I doubt not but you
          will give your generallitie good contente, and setle peace amongst
          your selves, and peace with the natives; and then no doubt but y<sup>e</sup>
          God of Peace will blese your going out &amp; your returning, and cause
          all y<sup>t</sup> you sett your hands unto to prosper; the which I
          shall ever pray y<sup>e</sup> Lord to grante if it be his blessed
          will. Asuredly unless y<sup>e</sup> Lord be mercifull unto us &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
          whole land in generall, our estate &amp; condition is farr worse then
          yours. Wherfore if y<sup>e</sup> Lord should send persecution or
          trouble hear, (which is much to be feared,) and so should put into our
          minds to flye for refuge, I know no place safer then to come to you,
          (for all Europ is at varience one with another, but cheefly w<sup>th</sup>
          us,) not doubting but to find such frendly entertainmente as shall be
          honest &amp; conscionable, notwithstanding what hath latly passed. For
          I profess in y<sup>e</sup> word of an honest man, had it not been to
          procure your peace &amp; quiet from some turbulent spirites hear, I
          would not have sealed to this last deed; though you would have given
          me all my adventure and debte ready downe. Thus desiring y<sup>e</sup>
          Lord to blesse &amp; prosper you, I cease ever resting,

          September" of this year. "The murtherer expected that, either for want
          of power to execute for capital offences, or for want of people to
          increase the plantation, he should have his life spared; but justice
          otherwise determined, and rewarded him, the first murtherer of his
          neighbour there, with the deserved punishment of death, for a warning
          to others." The first offence committed in the colony was by
          Billington, in 1621, who, for contempt of the Captain's lawful
          command, with opprobious speeches, was adjudged to have his neck and
          heels tied together. Prince, I. 103, from Bradford's pocket-book.
